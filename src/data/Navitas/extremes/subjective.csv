Not because formal professional development programs, HR policies, or a feeling that the company truly values you and your colleagues. If anything, the exact opposite is true. Rather, you will grow because you will be disappointed. Laughed at behind your back. You won’t get that promotion after years of hard work. The politics coming from the C-suite will paralyze any good ideas coming from you or your colleagues. Executives will care more about which airline or hotel they choose for the points than any of your ideas. You will also learn what it’s like not to be trusted. What it’s like when senior leaders hold months of ‘strategy’ meetings behind closed doors resulting in ended partnerships, severe layoffs, and weeks of self-doubt. You will have to find ways to tell potential students and partners that Navitas, as a global education company, no longer prioritizes the largest destination for international students—the United States. You will learn to play serious office politics. Will you become a favorite of those in charge? How far will you be willing to go to do their bidding? And who’s to say that this is worth it—especially if student recruitment numbers plummet? Have a back-up plan if you take employment. Don’t stop looking for new opportunities, and make friends with those that have been through the ringer the last few months. Reach out to former employees, instructors, and partners that have been made expendable.. Cons: What others have said about a company losing its soul is absolutely true. If you are a potential employee, part-time faculty member, or potential university partner, go somewhere else. This is a company facing threats from Australia (Thanks Camino!), the UK, and across North America. While US enrollment numbers have fallen by 50%, others like Shorelight Education and INTO have actually grown by investing in their people and technology. Just look at what happened at the University of New Hampshire, one of Navitas’s oldest US partners before Fall 2019. UNH was Navitas’ highest ranked US partner, with a new president that was eager to build a stronger private-public partnership. He even wrote a book about it, “The Insider’s Guide to Working with Universities.” Did Navitas executives read it? Buy it? Even look at the outside cover? I don’t think so. Not when they’re too busy cutting jobs, damaging the reputations of former adjunct faculty members, and trying to squeeze out a positive EBITDA. Its North American leadership team should resign out of sheer incompetence, lack of empathy, and a long list of broken promises.

High staff turnover, talented/competent people do not stay at Navitas, the staff who remain have very low motivation levels and are very negative about the company and management. Poor recruitment strategy: management do not put effort into recruiting suitable people for the long-term, focus is short-term ""bodies at desks"".

Cons: I’ve worked in finance for two and a half years and initially it was a nice place to work. However, it changed as soon as the new management came in and it fell apart rapidly! New members of staff don’t get properly trained and left in the deep end and when actually trying will get told off for doing things wrong. Which leaves you feeling like you’re not doing a good enough job. The way the staff were being treated was truly terrible, in fact on one occasion a manager actively tried to force a staff members out, outrageous! I’ve seen so many staff members spoken to with disrespect, you get spoken to like a child and not as a professional. The way in which management speak to people behind their backs is shocking and they have there favourites which has caused division in the whole of finance and ruined working relationships because of dis-trust. The staff know who are the favourites and who aren’t, if you’re aren’t then be prepared to be shunned and made to feel worthless. The staff turnover as a whole is very high, in finance alone since January this year 12 employees have left! During the summer I’ve seen four members of staff breakdown crying, four staff members go off sick due to stress and how the management have treated them including myself. No point going to HR they won’t do anything, they should be ashamed of themselves, to see how the staff have been treated and yet have done nothing about it. To rub salt in the wound they actually defend the management even if you have examples of how you’re being treated, it’s all swept under the carpet. Two managers in particular have no people skills, out right rude and are a disgrace how they treat there own staff. I’ve witnessed two members of staff crying because how they were spoken too by a particular manager. PLEASE DO NOT THINK OF WORKING HERE.

Cons: I have worked in arc admission for a long while.I’ve seen it go from decent to absolutely awful. The cause is the outrageous vile management behaviour. They are dreadful and should truly be ashamed of how they treat staff. They literally have a mentality that our staff is at the bottom of the food chain, so let’s just treat them like peasants. Underpaid and over worked. There has been so many complaints about how the pay is too low but all the management do is excuse the poor pay or say “if your not happy then just leave” disgusting response by management. I have seen certain people singled out by management. This company knows nothing about fairness and equality. When you go to higher management with a valid complaint about a line manager you will just be told that no manager is perfect but when it’s the other way round they will try to get rid of you. High staff turn over, not allowed to even speak to your colleagues without managers on your back it’s very much a prison like environment. Almost like “do your work you will only get your meal at lunch time”. Thinking of going to HR ? Think again. They are just as bad, half of the HR don’t care the other half are nasty they will take the side of the managers and look to conspire against you for even bringing up a valid complaint. HR in this company are not mediators but 100 percent on managers side they don’t try to hide it. Even when the managers are in the wrong they are absolutely vile, they verbally abuse you and tell you no one likes you and your years of service don’t mean that they owe you anything. HR you should feel disgusted within yourself, Both HR and management should be ashamed of yourselves you are not nice people let alone employers. You will get promoted if you are a brown noser or a snake. Thinking of working here? DONT turn back around and go find a nice company to work for, you deserve more than this disgusting management. I’d like to say all departments in navitas are different but I’ve even seen finance being treated in an awful way by management, again high staff turn over. Surely if you see so many people leaving with the same complaints you’d question your management skills all these people can’t just be feeling the same way if it was genuinely a nice place to work.

If you do not fit within the same personality as all others you will be seen as a ‘bad employee’ and managers will actually call you rude names behind your back. They will try to push you out. It’s like a popularity contest and if they have an issue with you, it doesn’t matter how good of an employee you are or how well you work with the students. The management is horrible, they do not have sufficient training, people with no people skills get promoted and their opinion will always matter more than non management employees. There’s no point involving HR, as they will just back up managers and come up with excuses. There’s literally no one to turn to if you feel discriminated against, they will give you a general email of how they work for staff wellbeing and that any discrimination allegations must be not true. The pay is dreadful, they will not pay overtime, even when you have done 12 hour days. And if you have done overtime and the following week you need to leave an hour early, they will make you work it off and you cannot use the overtime hours you’ve done, as that is just expected from you. When I compared the pay with other higher education establishments, the difference for the same position was around £7000 less a year. There’s barely any training. They will throw you in the middle of everything and then tell you off for not knowing how to do things correctly. I wish I was exaggerating about that. Management will give you conflicting feedback and then pretend like they never did that. Their structure and staff development is dreadful. For the sake of your happiness and wellbeing, do not work for any of the Navitas colleges.",Student Advisor,,reviews,subjective,negative,

13927,13927,,Navitas,27/12/2017,A company who talks the talk but certainly does not walk the walk,1.0,"Pros: Excellent team ethos amongst lower level staff and I've made some amazing life-long friends. Good salary, good holiday allowance but this is where I start to struggle.... Cons: The company certainly talks alot about its staff in the Colleges and have put together some incentives to show they are willing but the truth is, it's all lip service. When it comes down to the nitty gritty, they don't want to know. There is no progression within the BU's and neither is there support, mentoring or nurturing. Ideas and suggestions for improvement fall on deaf ears. Over the last couple of years, several senior figures have jumped ship (or have been pushed) and this has had a significant impact on the Colleges. Morale is shockingly low as more and more pressure and work is put on lower level staff all due to a bad decision to shift to centralise shared services. This doesn't work well as the company has now lost loyal, trusted, experienced staff across the board. There is a serious concern regarding bullying and archaic methods used by certain Senior Management towards staff. Due to the nature of the HR department they are not approachable with such concerns.",Anonymous Employee,"London, England",reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: Poor work / life balance, expected to regularly work overtime without receiving the time back. Poor change management, there's been a huge shift towards central shared services which does not work. The people on the ground in the colleges are left to pick up the pieces.
