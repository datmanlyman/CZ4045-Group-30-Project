Cons: Unprofessional and inexperienced management that despite having deep education sector experience, do not know how to run a business or manage people. High staff turnover, talented/competent people do not stay at Navitas, the staff who remain have very low motivation levels and are very negative about the company and management. Poor recruitment strategy: management do not put effort into recruiting suitable people for the long-term, focus is short-term ""bodies at desks"".

13887,13887,Navitas,13/11/2019,Wasn’t a nice place to work,1.0,"Pros: Most of my colleagues were great, they deserve more.. Cons: I’ve worked in finance for two and a half years and initially it was a nice place to work. However, it changed as soon as the new management came in and it fell apart rapidly! New members of staff don’t get properly trained and left in the deep end and when actually trying will get told off for doing things wrong. Which leaves you feeling like you’re not doing a good enough job. The way the staff were being treated was truly terrible, in fact on one occasion a manager actively tried to force a staff members out, outrageous! I’ve seen so many staff members spoken to with disrespect, you get spoken to like a child and not as a professional. The way in which management speak to people behind their backs is shocking and they have there favourites which has caused division in the whole of finance and ruined working relationships because of dis-trust. The staff know who are the favourites and who aren’t, if you’re aren’t then be prepared to be shunned and made to feel worthless. The staff turnover as a whole is very high, in finance alone since January this year 12 employees have left! During the summer I’ve seen four members of staff breakdown crying, four staff members go off sick due to stress and how the management have treated them including myself. No point going to HR they won’t do anything, they should be ashamed of themselves, to see how the staff have been treated and yet have done nothing about it. To rub salt in the wound they actually defend the management even if you have examples of how you’re being treated, it’s all swept under the carpet. Two managers in particular have no people skills, out right rude and are a disgrace how they treat there own staff. I’ve witnessed two members of staff crying because how they were spoken too by a particular manager. PLEASE DO NOT THINK OF WORKING HERE.

13888,13888,Navitas,25/10/2019,One word to describe this company: ABYSMAL,1.0,"Pros: There are no pros about this company. Cons: I have worked in arc admission for a long while.I’ve seen it go from decent to absolutely awful. The cause is the outrageous vile management behaviour. They are dreadful and should truly be ashamed of how they treat staff. They literally have a mentality that our staff is at the bottom of the food chain, so let’s just treat them like peasants. Underpaid and over worked. There has been so many complaints about how the pay is too low but all the management do is excuse the poor pay or say “if your not happy then just leave” disgusting response by management. I have seen certain people singled out by management. This company knows nothing about fairness and equality. When you go to higher management with a valid complaint about a line manager you will just be told that no manager is perfect but when it’s the other way round they will try to get rid of you. High staff turn over, not allowed to even speak to your colleagues without managers on your back it’s very much a prison like environment. Almost like “do your work you will only get your meal at lunch time”. Thinking of going to HR ? Think again. They are just as bad, half of the HR don’t care the other half are nasty they will take the side of the managers and look to conspire against you for even bringing up a valid complaint. HR in this company are not mediators but 100 percent on managers side they don’t try to hide it. Even when the managers are in the wrong they are absolutely vile, they verbally abuse you and tell you no one likes you and your years of service don’t mean that they owe you anything. HR you should feel disgusted within yourself, Both HR and management should be ashamed of yourselves you are not nice people let alone employers. You will get promoted if you are a brown noser or a snake. Thinking of working here? DONT turn back around and go find a nice company to work for, you deserve more than this disgusting management. I’d like to say all departments in navitas are different but I’ve even seen finance being treated in an awful way by management, again high staff turn over. Surely if you see so many people leaving with the same complaints you’d question your management skills all these people can’t just be feeling the same way if it was genuinely a nice place to work.

Good salary, good holiday allowance but this is where I start to struggle.... Cons: The company certainly talks alot about its staff in the Colleges and have put together some incentives to show they are willing but the truth is, it's all lip service. When it comes down to the nitty gritty, they don't want to know. There is no progression within the BU's and neither is there support, mentoring or nurturing. Ideas and suggestions for improvement fall on deaf ears. Over the last couple of years, several senior figures have jumped ship (or have been pushed) and this has had a significant impact on the Colleges. Morale is shockingly low as more and more pressure and work is put on lower level staff all due to a bad decision to shift to centralise shared services. This doesn't work well as the company has now lost loyal, trusted, experienced staff across the board.
