There is a cultural tension between the maximisation of profits and trying to run a university campus focused on academic excellence.

13870,13870,Navitas,15/3/2020,Untrustworthy Sinking Ship,1.0,"Pros: First, you will grow as a professional. Not because formal professional development programs, HR policies, or a feeling that the company truly values you and your colleagues. If anything, the exact opposite is true. Rather, you will grow because you will be disappointed. Laughed at behind your back. You won’t get that promotion after years of hard work. The politics coming from the C-suite will paralyze any good ideas coming from you or your colleagues. Executives will care more about which airline or hotel they choose for the points than any of your ideas. You will also learn what it’s like not to be trusted. What it’s like when senior leaders hold months of ‘strategy’ meetings behind closed doors resulting in ended partnerships, severe layoffs, and weeks of self-doubt. You will have to find ways to tell potential students and partners that Navitas, as a global education company, no longer prioritizes the largest destination for international students—the United States. You will learn to play serious office politics. Will you become a favorite of those in charge? How far will you be willing to go to do their bidding? And who’s to say that this is worth it—especially if student recruitment numbers plummet? Have a back-up plan if you take employment. Don’t stop looking for new opportunities, and make friends with those that have been through the ringer the last few months. Reach out to former employees, instructors, and partners that have been made expendable.. Cons: What others have said about a company losing its soul is absolutely true. If you are a potential employee, part-time faculty member, or potential university partner, go somewhere else. This is a company facing threats from Australia (Thanks Camino!), the UK, and across North America. While US enrollment numbers have fallen by 50%, others like Shorelight Education and INTO have actually grown by investing in their people and technology. Just look at what happened at the University of New Hampshire, one of Navitas’s oldest US partners before Fall 2019. UNH was Navitas’ highest ranked US partner, with a new president that was eager to build a stronger private-public partnership. He even wrote a book about it, “The Insider’s Guide to Working with Universities.” Did Navitas executives read it? Buy it? Even look at the outside cover? I don’t think so. Not when they’re too busy cutting jobs, damaging the reputations of former adjunct faculty members, and trying to squeeze out a positive EBITDA. Its North American leadership team should resign out of sheer incompetence, lack of empathy, and a long list of broken promises. When you take a job, and you’re told you need to move and you don’t—what kind of message does that say to others that did?",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9618,0.057076446,positive,positive

The upper management team is highly paid and they do not bother about other departments.Very less compensation for non managerial team. No job security. Zero learnings and zero development. They don't really have good understanding of what skills they are hiring and what work they offer.

Cons: They will portray that they are friendly and care about their staff when in reality it is just a front. My first impression about them was great, but soon I discovered that it was all fake. If you do not fit within the same personality as all others you will be seen as a ‘bad employee’ and managers will actually call you rude names behind your back. They will try to push you out. It’s like a popularity contest and if they have an issue with you, it doesn’t matter how good of an employee you are or how well you work with the students. The management is horrible, they do not have sufficient training, people with no people skills get promoted and their opinion will always matter more than non management employees. There’s no point involving HR, as they will just back up managers and come up with excuses. There’s literally no one to turn to if you feel discriminated against, they will give you a general email of how they work for staff wellbeing and that any discrimination allegations must be not true. The pay is dreadful, they will not pay overtime, even when you have done 12 hour days. And if you have done overtime and the following week you need to leave an hour early, they will make you work it off and you cannot use the overtime hours you’ve done, as that is just expected from you. When I compared the pay with other higher education establishments, the difference for the same position was around £7000 less a year. There’s barely any training. They will throw you in the middle of everything and then tell you off for not knowing how to do things correctly. I wish I was exaggerating about that. Management will give you conflicting feedback and then pretend like they never did that. Their structure and staff development is dreadful.
