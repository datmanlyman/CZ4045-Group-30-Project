A butcher knife hangs over your neck every single second. You'll never know when you are the next to go. 2. Very extreme case of top-down management. Your opinion does not matter. It's either you do what you are told or be fired. 3. When HR/HRBP tells you everything is 'well', it's usually quite the opposite. They act as if we care, but they don't and they can't. 4. Get pelted with vulgarities by the 'pseudo' CEO. Some people think this can't happen. I know. Don't be shocked. It's a thing here. 5. The company hires non-Chinese speaking talents but meetings and documents are in Chinese.

Some people might find it too difficult to adapt to, but I believe this is the perfect mode for an ever-changing industry. Changes bring opportunities, and you can try things that you wouldn't dare or imagine to do in the past. This is one of the biggest benefit, in my opinion. The company creates a platform for people to grow and shine, as long as you are prepared. Literally speaking, impossible is nothing, and the sky is the limit. People around you are young, energetic, fun and down-to-earth. It is rare to find this type of environment in Hong Kong. Management is straight-forward and understanding. They have high hopes and tight delivery schedule, but don't make impossible demands. Also, say goodbye to the bureaucracy that drives many talents crazy in the traditional banking industry. In OKEx, everyone is working towards the same goal and you can really feel the energy. Although there are still issues around internal processes and still much can be improved, overall it is moving on the right track at the right speed..

I joined this company because I love this industry. My first impression is that in similar industries, its salary is significantly higher than other companies. There are also many opportunities for promotion in the work process. Each person has 2 chances of promotion and salary increase every year. This company attaches great importance to the abilities of its employees. The position and salary must match your abilities, and the company is willing to contribute a lot of resources to help each employee improve their abilities in all aspects. In addition, every colleague in the company is very friendly, and there has never been any unpleasant things between us. The company often organizes tours,,various sports clubs, etc., also prepares birthday gifts and holiday gifts for us. Leaders are very nice.. Cons: overtime is definitely inevitable. It is necessary to have a certain degree of stress resistance. OKR and KPI will be ordered periodically, and work efficiency needs to be very high.
