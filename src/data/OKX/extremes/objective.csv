A butcher knife hangs over your neck every single second. You'll never know when you are the next to go. 2. Very extreme case of top-down management. Your opinion does not matter. It's either you do what you are told or be fired. 3. When HR/HRBP tells you everything is 'well', it's usually quite the opposite. They act as if we care, but they don't and they can't. 4. Get pelted with vulgarities by the 'pseudo' CEO. Some people think this can't happen. I know. Don't be shocked. It's a thing here. 5. The company hires non-Chinese speaking talents but meetings and documents are in Chinese. If you don't know Chinese, it's your problem. 6. .... and many more Whatever cons you can think of, it's probably happening here.
