10088,10088,Tribal Worldwide,14/6/2022,A sinking ship with no captains,1.0,"Pros: - High profile clients - The occasional project that is exciting to deliver - Some attempt at non-work related activities. Cons: - Uncreative and dull projects most of the time (contact forms are 90% of the tech projects) - Heavily under resourced teams which often leads to ""0.8 hours on project A, 1.7 hours on project B"" etc. - Zero progression, training, support etc. - Factory worker style management - Anyone without 'chief' in their name gets ignored. Top down run company with a LOT of red tape. See something broken that everyone complains about? Tough - it's going to stay that way. - High turnover of staff which proves the company doesn't care about it's employees. - Resource gets pulled between projects, but when no time is left to deliver, they force you to deliver via evening/weekend working for free, with no change to deadline. - Enforced 2 day per week hybrid model (it should be the employee's choice not the employer's) - A lot of low skilled people in various positions which leads to a general lack of accountability and passion when the project goes inevitably over budget, over deadline and on fire - Various people in PM/Delivery that are rude and have zero empathy nor emotional intelligence and believe the only way to manage a team is to micromanage to death - Decade old tech riddled with spaghetti-code that no-one can be arsed to fix aside from a few middle-management employees that often get laughed at when asking for time to fix it because it doesn't 'make money' - Janky IT Infrastructure (VPN goes down depending on what direction the wind blows) with cheap outsourced IT Support team that are slow to respond to critical blockers that even the CEO complains about but is powerless to fix it (or doesn't want to fix because they're cheap)",Anonymous Employee,"London, England",reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.9769,0.046421569,negative,positive

Cons: - Very poor leadership. MD and managers don't care about employees and they make that clear. - Quick turnaround. Staff are always leaving out of frustration and being replaced by less qualified people. - White men are championed in this workplace. - Long hours, low pay. Days in lieu aren't a possibility, despite working many weekends. - No possibility for career progression.

Collaborate with other areas of the group (DDB Group). Cons: No business vision. No business plan. Goals constantly shift. MD does not understand and very little experience in business management. Micromanaged by MD. No adequate processes / processes are adopted and dropped for reverting back to reactive management (firefighting). No adequate project management - no adequate planning (concurrent projects/ same resources), every project is the result of resources being shifted every way to firefight the issues of the day. The only reason projects get done is to the merit from the talent and amount of effort (overtime) of the individuals doing the job. No SLAs with clients, so employees are contacted and asked to work at any hour outside of hours, weekends, public holidays, annual leave (I personally was asked to work while I was away on annual leave on more than 2 occasion.

10201,10201,Tribal Worldwide,22/11/2010,Once great Tribal being eroded by DDB UK ignorance,1.0,"Pros: Once upon a time there was a great digital agency called TribalDDB. They even were rated by AdAge as the Global Agency of the Year in 2007 - cool! They attracted really smart talent and were highly innovative in their creativity and technology.. Cons: Then DDB recognised that their major clients like VW and Philips started spending more money on digital than on old ad formats. Instead of embracing this as positive change, Granddad DDB felt the need to put on a baseball cap and try to lead TribalDDB. So they told TribalDDB's senior management that they were the most important part of the business. And they told them this again and again. And to demonstrate this they put just one person from a digital background on the management team and all those wearing baseball caps made the real decisions and would not let Tribal people earn the sort of money they did until the smart talent started to leave.",,"London, England",reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9866,0.25974026,positive,positive
