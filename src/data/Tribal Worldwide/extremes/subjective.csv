Might be worth adding ""DDB"" back into the name to elevate its reputation, though hard to see what DDB gains as a result.. Cons: New York office only. Very poor leadership team. Boasts about its small, boutique operation, which is actually a euphemism for its inability to grow. Around 70 employees, exceptionally small headcount for the digital arm of a top, global advertising agency. Collegial culture, which would be fine if were also high-performing. It's not. Decent creative product, but non-existent strategy and analytics product.

Cons: * No respect for the CEO at the time. Disorganized leadership. * No sense of organizational skills or management pedigree among leadership. * Culture of ""you need to be mean to get ahead"" seemed to be put in place by one of the senior managers and tricked down to the people that worked for her. * Employees don't like working there. When I joined, on day one, the guy training me excused himself after he was introduced to me, went to his boss and quit, effective immediately, and then came back, apologized, and explained to me why Tribal was such a miserable place to work.

Micromanaged by MD. No adequate processes / processes are adopted and dropped for reverting back to reactive management (firefighting). No adequate project management - no adequate planning (concurrent projects/ same resources), every project is the result of resources being shifted every way to firefight the issues of the day. The only reason projects get done is to the merit from the talent and amount of effort (overtime) of the individuals doing the job. No SLAs with clients, so employees are contacted and asked to work at any hour outside of hours, weekends, public holidays, annual leave (I personally was asked to work while I was away on annual leave on more than 2 occasion.

Of course, there's only a President, a CFO, a chief strategist that no one likes and one business director who doesn't actually run any businesses. And somehow two ECDs even though there's only three clients. There are so many fundamentally broken things in this little directionless shop, but it seems to ladder up to an incompetant president. Wow is he clueless on how to run a shop, how to read people, how to get clients. No one respects him, and that is reflected in the work output.

Cons: Then DDB recognised that their major clients like VW and Philips started spending more money on digital than on old ad formats. Instead of embracing this as positive change, Granddad DDB felt the need to put on a baseball cap and try to lead TribalDDB. So they told TribalDDB's senior management that they were the most important part of the business. And they told them this again and again.

Cons: Incredibly short deadlines, long hours, little to no work life balance, the quality of work often suffers in favor of getting things done quickly and cheaply. Turnover is very high. Raises and promotions come very slowly because they will often hire juniors to replace those who may be expecting a raise. (I came in as a junior and saw a couple seniors get the boot after me, then saw the same thing happen two years later when I still hadn't gotten a raise or bonus). It's a boys club, for sure, so you have to be okay with that if you're a woman working in the creative department there. Things have changed a lot since the massive layoffs in 2009, but the corporate culture and the things that caused Tribal to be unsuccessful still remain from what I hear.
