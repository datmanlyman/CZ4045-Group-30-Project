Cons: Incredibly short deadlines, long hours, little to no work life balance, the quality of work often suffers in favor of getting things done quickly and cheaply. Turnover is very high. Raises and promotions come very slowly because they will often hire juniors to replace those who may be expecting a raise. (I came in as a junior and saw a couple seniors get the boot after me, then saw the same thing happen two years later when I still hadn't gotten a raise or bonus). It's a boys club, for sure, so you have to be okay with that if you're a woman working in the creative department there. Things have changed a lot since the massive layoffs in 2009, but the corporate culture and the things that caused Tribal to be unsuccessful still remain from what I hear.
