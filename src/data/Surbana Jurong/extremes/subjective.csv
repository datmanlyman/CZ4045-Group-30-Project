Cons: for one it is hell as bureaucratic as you can think about. they tell you they care about the staff but they obviously dont. they hold ""conversations"" once in a while they are mainly one way. once there was an architect who asked a question that obviously didnt go well with the management and before you know it he's not around anymore. in the midst of acquiring many companies for ridiculous prices obviously the financial sheets suffered- of which as employees it was understandable. Then they did things like no bonus no increment etc, which as an employee you would solider through if you know that we are in this together. but nope, then you hear of them management flying first class to google and facebook campus in the states for ""site visits"" - how will you feel? there was once my boss went on a trip with one of the top management and it was one of those domestic flights where there was only economy class and this mr. top management gave scathing remarks about not being on business class. well well. also, you can draw a relationship tree for the top management and see how the company is related..or run for that matter.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,negative,en

If you're someone who still want to improve yourself or want to contribute your skills, stay far far away from this place. You'll be better off elsewhere, seriously.. Cons: 1. People don't leave bad companies, they leave bad managers. Working with IT managers that has neither the management, technical or people skill. Doesn't listen to advise from the team and will usually ""disappear"" when it's time for them to make decision or attend important IT meetings. 2. Workload unevenly distributed because they don't want to manage or take action. The more you help, the more work you get. 3. Spend time and effort in doing work process improvement when the manager and senior staffs still insist the team in following inefficient processes that were defined more than 15 years ago. As quoted by one of the manager, ""All of these improvement and streamlining are useless."" 4. At least five years for a promotion. And I'm not even talking about promotion to management level. 5. A lot of elderly staff that are not open to collaborate or cooperate and are there just waiting for their retirement. 6. Staffs unfairly appraised by the manager but there is no way for staff to fairly appraise these managers without retaliation from the manager. 7.

Cons: They don't follow proper SDLC to deliver a project which is a big disadvantage for development projects. Project managers do not know what they are suppose to do and when potential risks are being highlighted to them, they will ignore them rather than trying to mitigate them. Sales and delivery are much more important to management rather than the quality of work. The more you help, the more workload you get. Some senior analysts will ask you to help them to look into some tasks and those tasks will eventually be yours and you will be held responsible. It's either the senior analysts are just plain lazy or do not have the knowledge to perform their own tasks. They don't bother to learn as well.

Poor middle management, incompetent team leaders and directors who lack sufficient technical expertise and terrible at man-management yet are drawing significant pay. One wonders how it is possible for a department to clinch projects with an overall worth in 9 figures yet the department operates in the red. The money has to go somewhere.
