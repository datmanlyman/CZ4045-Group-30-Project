No work-life balance for Bus Operations & Automotive Maintenance Services. Can't even have a proper dinner & social life, with SMS keep coming. Really pity the MD of SMRT Roads for having such vicious senior management team akin to Siberian tigers devouring Mgrs & Execs for breakfasts. Challenge remains on how is he going to tame them. - Some of above statements might be an exaggeration while under-emphasizing in others but the underlying issues are real and deeply-rooted. - Family life totally destroyed with, spouses/parents/children complaining neglect.",Manager,Singapore,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.9736,-0.134583333,negative,negative

12659,12659,SMRT,26/10/2021,Toxic ex military *bosses* that has zero experience of rail industry but think they're gods,1.0,"Pros: Free public transportation, 13 months salary. Cons: Military-style middle management only wants to please their bosses; in doing so, they squeeze the life and soul out of their subordinates. Staff (execs) are forced to work extra hours to achieve the never-ending and unachievable expectations. Because why? Execs' time and efforts are free, unlike the non-execs, where they have to pay OT. With this in mind, execs are usually treated as non-human that does not deserve enough rest time or personal time. They are expected to reply to messages or emails instantly, regardless of the time of day or during off-work hours. When conflicts or faults arise at work, those who speak the truth are humiliated, blamed, and cursed in front of everyone. This is one of the reasons why your people LOVE telling you lies. They'll lie to your face every time because you will punish them for telling the truth that does not make you happy. Reporting to HR does not bring any changes because HR people are scared to say anything to the top management, afraid that their heads will be put on the chopping board. Non-execs have Union to back them up, but who do the execs have? No one. Last resort - they leave the company and leave a bad review of SMRT on websites like this so that their voices are finally heard, and the world could read and see the story behind the curtains.",Senior Engineer,,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.8588,0.020454545,negative,positive
