Cons: Military-style middle management only wants to please their bosses; in doing so, they squeeze the life and soul out of their subordinates. Staff (execs) are forced to work extra hours to achieve the never-ending and unachievable expectations. Because why? Execs' time and efforts are free, unlike the non-execs, where they have to pay OT. With this in mind, execs are usually treated as non-human that does not deserve enough rest time or personal time. They are expected to reply to messages or emails instantly, regardless of the time of day or during off-work hours. When conflicts or faults arise at work, those who speak the truth are humiliated, blamed, and cursed in front of everyone. This is one of the reasons why your people LOVE telling you lies. They'll lie to your face every time because you will punish them for telling the truth that does not make you happy.
