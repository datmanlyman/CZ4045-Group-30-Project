12618,12618,SMRT,24/9/2016,Poor Leadership (SMRT Commercial Division),1.0,"Pros: 1) Great Benefits & Compensation 2) Great Location of work centralise. Cons: Cons of SMRT Commercial Division 1) Leadership provides no clear direction or vision resulting in working level to run around like headless chickens.... a lost boat sailing in the ocean... 2) No clear org chart or job scope. Tasks are ad hoc & randomly assigned based on management's preference and not based on ability of staff. i.e. lack fair/even distribution of work and responsibilities... 3) Bureaucracy: Lots of meetings and discussions with no clear conclusion or direction... leading numerous rounds of approvals often with conflicting direction (flip flop) throughout the entire process... 4) Management/Leader push responsibilities among departments and most of them are not confident to make any decision or sign off anything... often ask junior staff for recommendation and direction... projects are often drop at the very last mile causing staff to feel demoralise... 5) Management/Leader lack experience in non-metro businesses... often when a project is approved with unrealistic goals, new hires are recruited and expected to deliver wonders... resulting in high turnover... 6) Turnover of staff is high in this division compared to other divisions 7) No proper training or guidance are provided to new staff... 8) Everyone is very busy but for unnecessary high amount of meetings and approvals.... The hours are not suitable for staff with family commitment...",,,reviews,subjective,neutral,,,0.5195,0.047309091,positive,positive
