Cons: The company is sales and results driven, and measured one performance based on sales figures and numbers, not so much of your effort and skills set. Learning wise, the environment focus a lot of your speed and sales skills in terms of telemarketing, not much to learn if you are thinking you can learn hr skills set from this role. The company also does not provide much enrichment and they promises on a one to one coaching and mentorship, but in face one will be thrown to the sea to survive or drown. Those who did not make it, many a times leave the company themselves, are forced to leave their own or are ask to leave. You do not get much say in the company as the leaders and directors have their own set of thinking as they have been with the company for a long time and have grown to have their own mind set that is in line with the company - If they want to do, do. If they can't do, go. The benefits to the staffs are minimal, much lower than the average market standards, so it is really the commission that you are looking at if you are joining. If your sales is excellent, you get your fair share of the commission that you deserve, while if you did not meet your targets, be prepared to suffer a 20% paycut on your market-rate basic salary and risk getting underpaid and your alternate saturdays burn off to buck up your sales.",Recruitment Consultant,,reviews,objective,neutral,,,0.1779,0.280952381,positive,positive

Poor work culture - Supervisor was constantly nagging at me to call my friends down to push out temp jobs to. She was also persistently micromanaging every aspect of what I was doing and HOW I was doing them. (I achieved my highest weekly target during her one week absence) To add on, I overheard my branch manager giving an earful to my supervisor and right afterwards, my supervisor did the same to me in almost the exact same words the manager said to her. It seems that the blame is passed down in this MLM-ish style business model. 2. Outdated information systems - Only a single work station was available to a team of about three to four employees. There was a function to search for candidates in the company's candidate database but it was not made aware to me until after a month into the job. Even so, most of the processes were done manually with pen and paper (we had to bring a pen and a notebook around to seniors in the morning to get client job orders and then they would each send us emails with the exact same details later in the day).

You'll be posting ads about banking/white-collar jobs, but eventually have to talk your way to make candidates take up flyer distribution/sales job. - Ridiculous quotas, even if met, will be forced to do more and more and more - Treat candidates like a commodity, don't care about their interest, just care about sales target - Head boss loves to overstep the professional relationship boundary with ladies. Will cheekily ask you out for lunch dates. If you do not suck up to him, forget about any promotions - 3 people share one computer and one e-mail address - Very hierarchical. You take a cut of your intern's pay, your Director takes a cut of your pay, then the owner takes a cut of your pay. Leaving the actual candidate with almost 40% of his pay gone - Expect you to stay in office till late. If you even dare to step out of the office before 6pm it's GG for you the next day, the bitching will begin - The environment is so political. It's straight out from the set of Mean Girls. Everyone is bitching and stealing candidates from one another and when confronted about it, will plaster on a fake smile denying any involvement - Weekly meetings with the director are like throwing two lions into a pit. Director will play one person off another - Nearly once a month will have team bonding events which further shows how hypocritical the environment is. No one actually likes one another. I strongly advise against joining this company, especially the Ngee Ann City outlet. If you have any semblance of morality, you'll find this job hell. I joined HR because I wanted to help people get jobs they like and interact with candidates, but instead was told to lie about the job scope, pay and even company to get them down for an interview.
