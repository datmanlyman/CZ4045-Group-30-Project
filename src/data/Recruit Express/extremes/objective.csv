Learning wise, the environment focus a lot of your speed and sales skills in terms of telemarketing, not much to learn if you are thinking you can learn hr skills set from this role. The company also does not provide much enrichment and they promises on a one to one coaching and mentorship, but in face one will be thrown to the sea to survive or drown. Those who did not make it, many a times leave the company themselves, are forced to leave their own or are ask to leave. You do not get much say in the company as the leaders and directors have their own set of thinking as they have been with the company for a long time and have grown to have their own mind set that is in line with the company - If they want to do, do. If they can't do, go. The benefits to the staffs are minimal, much lower than the average market standards, so it is really the commission that you are looking at if you are joining. If your sales is excellent, you get your fair share of the commission that you deserve, while if you did not meet your targets, be prepared to suffer a 20% paycut on your market-rate basic salary and risk getting underpaid and your alternate saturdays burn off to buck up your sales.",Recruitment Consultant,,reviews,objective,neutral,
