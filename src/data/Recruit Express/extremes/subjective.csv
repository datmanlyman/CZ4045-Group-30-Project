Cons: Unethical practices, hr team does not know hr process and lack of updated mom rules and regulations and hr like to gossip behind employees , CEO love to dig into your personal life and If u are not in his good book, no matter how much $ u earn for the company he will still find ways to criticize u. Employees are allowed to behave childishly , criticism and pass personal comments and attack on others. To survive here, u will need to join clan and behave similarly like the rest to gossip and criticize. A lot of cats fight between employees and unneccessary long meeting to discuss non- work related issue. Unless u are presentable and into CEO book, don't even think of getting praise for your hard work. Promotion is only based on timing if CEO like u, u can be promoted rapidly.

Cons: Taking into consideration as a full timer. RE apply 80/20 rule, after 2nd month if your 3rd months doesn’t hit your target which is 3times of your payroll cost, they will deduct 20% of your salary. Well, technically it’s legal. The will put 80% as your basic and 20% as the deductible component under the MOM term in the LOA. If you are lucky, you get to take your employment license early to engage yourself to deal with permanent roles to hit your KPI. If not, good luck! All you can do is to handle contract roles. Besides that RE commission for per contract role is only $8. In addition, if they feel that you don’t do well in your KPI. They won’t confirm you regardless how many months being with RE. With that, if you resign it will be 2weeks notice and 2weeks penalty. They deem the penalty as their company loss and term it as a training cost. But actual fact, no proper training was provided. Only on job training and a few sales talk session by the CEO. So they will recover that 2weeks salary from you. In short, you are at a losing end if you don’t sound out to the HR. Anw, their HR team also useless. “Yes” man mode. No point. Maybe can try complain MOM? Another side is that RE lacks of IT resources, consultants have to share computer and use general email address. Pathetic much. I guess, quite a sales driven and distinct culture to work in. Hence, I am glad that I didn’t stay long and recognise that I am not a sales material.
