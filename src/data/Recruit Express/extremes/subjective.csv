If u like an environment that focus more on play, fighting and surrounded by kids and gossipy mothers, this is definitely the environment to be in. Cons: Unethical practices, hr team does not know hr process and lack of updated mom rules and regulations and hr like to gossip behind employees , CEO love to dig into your personal life and If u are not in his good book, no matter how much $ u earn for the company he will still find ways to criticize u. Employees are allowed to behave childishly , criticism and pass personal comments and attack on others. To survive here, u will need to join clan and behave similarly like the rest to gossip and criticize. A lot of cats fight between employees and unneccessary long meeting to discuss non- work related issue. Unless u are presentable and into CEO book, don't even think of getting praise for your hard work. Promotion is only based on timing if CEO like u, u can be promoted rapidly. This company hire a lot of temporary recruitment consultant to ""help"" the sales during hot period , but actually is to fill in the gap coz there are many ""managers"" with one subordinate and some OMO too.",Consultant,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,en

Cons: Unethical - Just dump any jobs to candidate to fulfill quota and commission. It could also mean that there is a possibility that the applicant is a bad fit, but the practice there is to shove it to him nevertheless. If the applicant is unsuccessful or fussy with their interviews, we move on to the next target and just leave him hanging. So by nature, the is a tendency to force applicant to take whatever jobs we dish it to him, all we want is his cooperation.

Cons: Taking into consideration as a full timer. RE apply 80/20 rule, after 2nd month if your 3rd months doesn’t hit your target which is 3times of your payroll cost, they will deduct 20% of your salary. Well, technically it’s legal. The will put 80% as your basic and 20% as the deductible component under the MOM term in the LOA. If you are lucky, you get to take your employment license early to engage yourself to deal with permanent roles to hit your KPI. If not, good luck! All you can do is to handle contract roles. Besides that RE commission for per contract role is only $8. In addition, if they feel that you don’t do well in your KPI. They won’t confirm you regardless how many months being with RE. With that, if you resign it will be 2weeks notice and 2weeks penalty. They deem the penalty as their company loss and term it as a training cost. But actual fact, no proper training was provided. Only on job training and a few sales talk session by the CEO. So they will recover that 2weeks salary from you. In short, you are at a losing end if you don’t sound out to the HR. Anw, their HR team also useless. “Yes” man mode. No point. Maybe can try complain MOM? Another side is that RE lacks of IT resources, consultants have to share computer and use general email address. Pathetic much. I guess, quite a sales driven and distinct culture to work in. Hence, I am glad that I didn’t stay long and recognise that I am not a sales material.

There was a function to search for candidates in the company's candidate database but it was not made aware to me until after a month into the job.

13301,13301,,Recruit Express,11/1/2018,Senior Consultant,5.0,"Pros: I have worked for Recruit Express Hong Kong for more than 3 years and can't imagine leaving! Over the years, I have made so many positive changes. It becomes a much better workplace because leaders took the time to listen to employees. Managers at this company are really effective at leading their teams. They show that they care about employees by sitting down with us one-on-one to discuss our futures, the projects we're working on, and any challenges that stand in our way. You don't realize how much you need a caring and effective manager until you're on a team that actually has one. The leaders are truly invested in each individual's growth and success. It's nice working for people who actually care about your future and invest time and money to help you be successful. So I would say it is a good platform for fresh graduates.. Cons: working hour 830am to 530pm.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,positive,

Cons: They will deduct your basic salary if you can't achieve their monthly target, even you close a big deal last month, they still deduct 20% of your basic salary if you don't have any sales this month really low incentives rate , only 2.5% . That mean if you close a 100k deal you only get less than 1000 after they deduct your 3x target per month Authoritarian management style, senior always try hard to brainwash employees who good they are.
