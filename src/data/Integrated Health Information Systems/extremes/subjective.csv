Cons: It's amazing the holes from which people are hired to take up management positions up to senior director levels. They may have been in senior positions in their previous jobs, but surely existing IHiS management should be more stringent in the hiring process so that vacancies aren't filled by unprofessional incompetent useless bums. Yet it's so easy for any old subpar bum to get the job, and remain in it even though the top levels of management are the ROs of these bums and know that they aren't performing but throwing everything to their subordinates. There are so many ineffective figures in management who play taichi the whole day and who gallavant around Singapore during office hours enjoying life, instead of taking ownership and doing real work. You'd think their conscience would call out to them, because their salary comes from taxpayers' money. Nope. Many of these same bums are also rude and oppressive towards their subordinates and junior staff. And they often hire people who are just as incompetent with crap non-team player attitudes, and the ""virus"" spreads. So you know what happens? The good people get frustrated and quit, and the lousy ones stay on and multiply. HR does not care and will not help you. There are wayang initiatives like birthday vouchers, CSR initiatives and IHiS academy and what not, but if you can't even treat people decently and fairly and ensure people are treated decently and fairly, what's the point? It's amusing and disgusting at the same time how some HR people think they are so capable, and they go for coaching courses thinking they are now some expert on people development, when they can't even get the basics right. IHiS published some FB post telling staff that if they feel distressed they can call their HR business partner. Yet when staff do that, they get told things like they should be grateful they have a job, or that if they didn't do anything wrong they shouldn't worry. I tell my colleagues to forget about HR and just call the SOS hotline. When IHiS needs you, the bosses may still be somewhat polite. After you tender, be prepared for them to be nasty, throwing hurdles your way, making you jump through hoops, gaslighting you and sucking you dry till you leave. They may say/promise you one thing, but don't expect anyone to keep their word. Don't expect any gratitude for any OT you put in before you tendered, and while you are serving notice. I know of many colleagues who sacrificed their health and time with their family, and who had fights with their spouses because of work overload and pressure from bosses. They worked while on medical/hospitalisation leave, or didn't take medical leave. Their annual leave got forfeited, and their bosses refused to give them time off in lieu. Management may wayang a bit, but make no mistake, management does not give a crap.

Busy one getting busier over time and need to handle almost ALL areas in the project. 2. Unclear lines of communication - many incompetent managers in a team those only do talking and assigning work with very vague requirements and processes. They won't be able to guide or won't take ownership when decision making required. 3. Lack of collaboration - no transparency among cross functional teams in a department.

7729,7729,Integrated Health Information Systems,26/9/2019,Toxic environment filled with incompetent people,1.0,"Pros: Market or slightly higher than market salaries for IT staff (probably otherwise cannot attract and keep staff).. Cons: Many. Where to start? Internally very very messy. People are fighting fire after fire, and no one is sitting down to examine the root cause and plan. Many staff tired and squeezed dry. Most people left are directors' favourites or taichi masters. Is that really the kind of people you want your company to be full of? Some management figures so insecure they create silos of information and a culture of secrecy, so that only they know the full story, and staff cannot do their job efficiently or properly. Some others mismanage their department and play favourites, allow disgusting bad behaviour to continue. Many PMs hate to work with someone in legal department who is famous for being rude and shouting at vendors and even own colleagues. Still can get promoted. What does it say about ihis? That bad behaviour is ok, even encouraged and rewarded. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many incompetent people at AD, DD and D levels. Some cannot even form proper sentences in English and everyone wonders what they are talking about. They don't even know what they are doing. When they are asked questions they ask their staff, and respond using their staff's answers under their own name. What a joke. Top of the top management doesn't even know, or maybe doesn't care. Forget about career growth and training and development. If your course is above $500-1000, HOD will question. Above $1000 most likely reject.

Cons: Very, very bad management. The company constantly undergoes ""restructuring"" so teams change a lot and many times, the bosses have no idea what people are doing so a lot of time is wasted bringing them up to speed. There is also barely any communication with the staff so you essentially have to adapt to every politically-motivated decision they make at some senior-level meeting or conversely make decisions with zero direction. After a while, you start seeing a lot of headcount for certain ""high profile"" projects, with others literally begging for staff. If your project isn't one of them, it's just a miserable experience. Also, a number of the bosses are not approachable and pretty condescending. It is challenging to grow professionally in such an environment. In short, not a good place for anyone's career. Will just turn you off from the healthcare sector for good. Which is a pity since a lot of people join IHIS because they want to do fulfilling work.

Nearing my end of probation period, my manager said he didn't want me to stay because my learning was slow. In my point of view, if your department needs someone more experienced, do not hire a fresh grad!
