The part timer pay is way too low yet we were required to do the same or more work than the full timers. Another manager didn’t let part timer choose non-closing shifts just so that they could exploit them to clean the whole freaking shop by ourselves while the full timers just slack around. And why do part timers even have sales targets when they don’t get commission? It’s ridiculous. The way the break times are scheduled (by the manager) is also really dumb. For an 11am-8pm shift, they might assign you a break at 1pm-2pm and then you just have to deal with being hungry all the way till 8pm. (6 hours) The working environment is unsafe as well.
