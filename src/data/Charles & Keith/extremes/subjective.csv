Cons: Filled with young and bubbling staffs, but unfortunately the culture is more than rigid - top management are very unreceptive to good changes. Hierarchy is very prominent in the office, whilst some departments are regarded as greater than the others.

Cons: (1) Goals and plans to execute are often contradicting to each other (2) Pretentious - Encourages openness and tells you there is no right or wrong when asked of your honest feedback. But in reality it's just a trap to test your loyalty (3) Non-anonymous, non-impartial - Forget about bringing up any personal complaints or feedbacks to HR since they are probably the worst of all. HODs are probably friends with each other and you'll get a target on your back if something mentioned feels like a complaint.

4763,4763,,Charles & Keith,28/1/2020,-,5.0,"I like that the company organises Christmas parties so that we can bring our children to the office. During the party, in addition to the Christmas buffet lunch there were also free ice-cream (Udders), Gongcha bubble tea, photobooth, caricature artists, henna tattoo etc. It was really fun for my colleagues and especially for my kids. They get to see where I work and I dont have to worry about childcare arrangement that day because we are allowed to go home early after the party. 

Other aspect of benefits I enjoy is that I earn time off hours when I work beyond hours. This means that if I have to work really late for a a few days or during weekend, I can take time off work the following week if schedule permits. Its as flexible as taking 1-2 hours time off to start work later or to take time off towards the end of the day (which means a shorter work day for me for that day). In other companies, as an executive you dont get hours paid back to you, so I really appreciate the work-hours flexibility as a parent.

Lastly, we have short work day every 1st Friday of the month. Again, I have never had such a “luxury” in previous companies I worked in.",-,Singapore,benefits,subjective,positive,

An employee only gets paid well if he/she is in the ""inner circle"" of the management team. Employees overloaded and overworked, doing tasks that are beyond their scope and expertise. Pay doesn't match up to the amount of effort and time they put into the business.

(Please join this company if you are good with handling bosses and make them like you. You will do great). - No clear direction, resulting in huge talent outflow, causing remaining employees to be overworked. Yet, headcounts are freezed. - Lack of guidance from mid management (Ask them a question and they will reply with “so what will you do if you were me?”). - Not willing to hire experienced employees yet expect fresh graduate to be of senior employee standard. - Management would rather spend the money to hire people to cultivate “CK culture” instead of self-reflection and ensure that employees earn what they deserved.",Planner,,reviews,subjective,negative,

Also I don’t know how they choose store managers but mine were UNREASONABLE and IMPOSSIBLE to communicate with. One couldn’t even understand simple things i told him in English. The part timer pay is way too low yet we were required to do the same or more work than the full timers. Another manager didn’t let part timer choose non-closing shifts just so that they could exploit them to clean the whole freaking shop by ourselves while the full timers just slack around. And why do part timers even have sales targets when they don’t get commission? It’s ridiculous. The way the break times are scheduled (by the manager) is also really dumb. For an 11am-8pm shift, they might assign you a break at 1pm-2pm and then you just have to deal with being hungry all the way till 8pm. (6 hours) The working environment is unsafe as well. We were required to climb the shelves to retrieve stocks for customers, and the shelves were pretty unstable with some almost falling apart. Extremely dangerous and the goods might fall on you and you might get injured. Overall, don’t recommend working here.

They don’t tell you the contract in details, so when something happen they will find other reasonings. - They say it’s flexible but because I’m new and I didn’t know that I have to say my preferred working time and they didn’t ask, so they put me as full shift and they say it can’t be changed. -The pay is too little for part timers.

Long story short, so long as there is ANY occasions or festivals except for Chinese Ghost festival, you are required to buy gifts for this higher management.
