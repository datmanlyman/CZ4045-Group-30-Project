4761,4761,Charles & Keith,28/1/2020,-,5.0,"I like that the company organises Christmas parties so that we can bring our children to the office. During the party, in addition to the Christmas buffet lunch there were also free ice-cream (Udders), Gongcha bubble tea, photobooth, caricature artists, henna tattoo etc. It was really fun for my colleagues and especially for my kids. They get to see where I work and I dont have to worry about childcare arrangement that day because we are allowed to go home early after the party. 

Other aspect of benefits I enjoy is that I earn time off hours when I work beyond hours. This means that if I have to work really late for a a few days or during weekend, I can take time off work the following week if schedule permits. Its as flexible as taking 1-2 hours time off to start work later or to take time off towards the end of the day (which means a shorter work day for me for that day). In other companies, as an executive you dont get hours paid back to you, so I really appreciate the work-hours flexibility as a parent.

Lastly, we have short work day every 1st Friday of the month. Again, I have never had such a “luxury” in previous companies I worked in.",-,Singapore,benefits,objective,positive,,,0.9838,0.028431373,positive,positive

Pay doesn't match up to the amount of effort and time they put into the business.
