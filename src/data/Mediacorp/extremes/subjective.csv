Starting to be more open minded in changes. Cons: Keep by the book, and stubborn. No room to upskill & almost no one is willing to improve for the better. Very in their own comfort zone, hence as a result very “in the box” …. Barely any creativity and very close minded. The industrial news that was received tend to be quite outdated and filtered. Though getting more open to change but, they do it in a more reluctant way. Very proud of what was not quite correct things, which these things can be done in a more effective and efficient way. Don’t know the words to use for the terms and even being corrected they still stubbornly use back what they are comfortable of. Really don’t recommend fresh grads to join as there isn’t much to learn from and they will tend to be “bully” by the “seniors” and taught the ineffective way of working. No room for improvements. Not enough seniors that can guide juniors, as some seniors were not very skilled and effective in doing things. The directions of what they looking for isn’t always clear. Though they gave references, the end results were no where near the look they asked for as most of the time they ask to make things “bigger” when their initial proposed reference were “sleek” and “simple”. All about budgeting and money… very money minded. As a result, some of the creative elements has to replaced which affects the end look. Almost ZERO communication, as a result sometimes having inconsistencies in one whole production. 1. Especially dramas, Same production yet splitting into different teams. Was told that this is to be more effective for producing the drama. However, there were different directions and inconsistencies during the shoot and ended up and always resulted in “fixing in post”. Then budgeting is another prob when “quotation” came in for “fixing in post”…. Always will needed up “no budget”. Always editors, directors, assistant directors and executive producer gave different comments which as a result have no idea who to listen to. However in the end, was told to follow EPs’ instructions. 2. In variety shows, when request for some looks/design, and due to budgeting, in-house will produce and provide them. However, when wasn’t used and was changed by other (outsource) designer/editors. The initial designer/artist was never informed about it. Then when issues appears they will blame the initial designer/artist and ask him/her make amendments accordingly. Furthermore , when there is issue they definitely won’t find what’s the problem, their 1st step of “solving” the issue was to head to the initial in-house designer/artist and point fingers at them. And demand for a solution as the deadline was tight… A lot of miscommunications and back stabbing. Has to be VERY CAREFUL OF WHAT WE SAY, always put on a “friendly” and “easy going” mask when talking to people. In general people like to put words in one’s mouth, so that to avoid being blame for wrong doings.

Cons: Company is so top heavy. Too many bosses. Too little workers. Lower level jobs have sub par salary. Work culture is rife with tribalism, responsibility shirking, victimisation, blame and nepotism that it promotes politicking & bootlicking instead of doing actual work. Inter-department communication is non existent. Everyone works in their own enclosed space without teamwork. Bosses have too much power that they can make you do non work-related tasks outside of your job scope for their personal gains. Lots of conflict of interest in purchasing from favourite vendors, potentially due to the powers given to bosses. Appraisal system works downwards only so management can never be faulted.

Lots of strange HR policies that are bureaucratic that doesn't apply to current employment standards. Very government in nature. However, too much self-inflicted censorship and pain. This company's HR policies is designed to protect the company and NOT for STAFF GROWTH.. Cons: Poor office culture due to ""top"" heavy legacy issues whereby many VPs, SVPs, or even EVPs are irrelevant and had not been re-skilled to keep up with times especially so in areas of moving onto mobile or digital TV via multi-screens. Compensation is pathetic compared to MNCs as you're rewarded only if your boss favours you. It is not work or competency driven, it is people relations driven. Training is only for senior mgmt or VPs. Staff are often asked to pay for their own training though related to work and even asked to take their own leave to attend those work related training. Then to their shock, horror and dismay, they see their own bosses attending these conferences or training for FREE while just a couple of days ago, their request for training had been rejected or the term they like to use ""NOT SANCTIONED"" by these very own bosses of whom they just bump into at the conference or training centre. What's more appalling, these bosses would even spring a surprise on your by gate-crashing or sneaking up on you at these conferences to steal ideas/content/ citing that they're your bosses, try to associate with your network then head back to the office and write cryptic emails to you demanding for pages of report writing on the conference while you've been asked to take your own personal leave and cost for the training/seminar/conference.

If you like being condescended to and having all your ideas shot down and treated horribly by your employer, this is an ideal place for you. Cons: Literally the worst and least professional place ever. Journalism is not a priority here, only keeping the PAP in power. Anyone with true skill or talent or experience in this field will be dismissed and denigrated in favour or those who are somehow friends with the management. Good like if you don't fall into a certain ethnic category! They really on fresh grads or people who are desperate to be in broadcast to continually join as people leave in disgust so frequently that sometime they have to freeze leave to keep the roster full.

9941,9941,,Mediacorp,26/2/2016,"Office politics is rife, low compensation, extremely poor benefits",1.0,"Pros: Casual dressing. However, wearing shorts, mini skirts and flirty tops don't portray a good image for the company. Occasional perks such as discounted concert tickets, free weekly magazine only for those who are into entertainment gossips. Delicious food from the canteen's duck rice stall but it's not moving to the new campus :(. Cons: See title above. And more below: LOTS OF GOSSIPERS. Management has no clear direction and the majority of the AVPs and VPs do not have the ability to manage staff, are arrogant and boot-lickers. Many boot-licking subordinates who try to get into the good books of their supervisors. Office politics literally THRIVE in this company. Taxi fare is only claimable if you work till 10pm or beyond (official working hours: 830am to 6pm). NO dinner allowance even if you work OT. 1 person handles the work of 2 persons. No work life balance and it's becoming worse with increasing staff turnover recently. In short, expect to work like a slave at a fraction of what you're being compensated. Many old-time employees (those who have worked there for 15 years or more) think they can step all over newer and less experienced staff. P.S. Phew! I'm soooooooo glad that I'm no longer working at this crappy company!",Accountant,,reviews,subjective,negative,
9942,9942,,Mediacorp,22/2/2016,Mediacorp,1.0,"Pros: 21 days of leave and benefits. Cons: low pay, overworked, unappreciative managers.

Not long after I joined, it took out low performers and reassigned a whole bunch of folk to new positions. Chief Shaun Seow is finally shaking things up! The company recognizes it needs to change, folks need to work harder and do things differently. The company's scale and role in society give rise to opportunities to do interesting and meaning work..

9955,9955,,Mediacorp,6/9/2015,Manager,1.0,"Pros: 21 days leave, good healthcare benefits.. Cons: There's no room for growth and no recognition for effort. Some departments are bleeding and there are long-time employees who can come to work with no clear contributions year in year out yet continue to stay on because of their connections to the management whilst there are those who contribute and yet live in fear of being axed. Don't bother looking for HR if you have a work issue, they will side the management more than anything else. Some huge investments were made in the last couple of years to divest the business but there are no clear signs of real results from these investments. So why are junior staff being penalised when it comes to HR cutting when the senior staff making those foolish decisions ought to be the ones to go?",Manager,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,
9958,9958,,Mediacorp,26/7/2015,Lousy management and HR,1.0,"Pros: Generous leave & healthcare benefits. Cons: Connections is all that matters here. My (ex) boss came in on the recommendations of the head of department. She impresses indeed - comes in to the office later than anyone else, leaves earlier than 6pm on the pretext of having imaginary meetings (the person she was supposed to meet happen to be overseas ahahah!!) and goes on leave without telling anyone (did she even apply???). With a boss who is MIA, things don't get done, you have to scramble to get everything settled, sometimes even at a higher cost to get things rectified. Of course she doesn't get any blame - it's her staff (us) who gets reprimanded by the head of department for not staying on top of things. At the end of the day, your work is not even appreciated and the ones who are rewarded are those who have connections with her (yes, more recommendations from the same clique). Oh and don't think you can go crying to the HR - they protect the bosses, not the worker bees.

9961,9961,,Mediacorp,14/7/2015,Zero Innovation,1.0,"Pros: Long lunch breaks, use free time for self-improvement/self-learning.. Cons: IT department is an ancient relic. IT project managers have minimal to zero knowledge of software development and know only definition of terms to sound knowledgeable. They're there to serve as seat warmers playing Chinese whispers passing emails while busy shopping in Zalora. The high-profile sounding, tech-related titles are being degraded because of their lack of work ethics and zero technical skill. Manager to employee ratio is 5:1. Lots of red tape to accomplish simple tasks. No avenue for career growth. You need to do self-study on new technologies. Ideas will be swayed or unacknowledged, initiatives/proactivity will be met with lots of questioning. Very dependent on part-time staff. Petty change pay raises. Way below industry standard pay, yet they expect you to perform as a full-stack/all-around developer. Still, they act surprised as to why IT positions are not being filled while current employees are leaving in droves. Even small conveniences like coffee or pantry are non-existent considering the ""MNC status"" of the company.",Software Developer,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,
9963,9963,,Mediacorp,1/7/2015,AVOID. Rotten culture with no HR,1.0,"Pros: Company is big and possible to learn a thing or two unless you are not overloaded.. Cons: Super political company. It doesn't matter what you know or do, as long as you suck up to your boss, eventhough she is wrong and incapable to lead. HR is non-existent and they are only there for show! High turnover rate as company is obsessed to achieve numbers by doing the same thing (not innovative) instead of nurturing and supporting staff. Higher management and senior leadership team are useless. Only join this company if you have zero pride as people will be condescending and treat you like you should know everything when you first joined. Publishing sector is a messy place to be. Generally, the company culture is really bad. Only the fittest survives.

Working hours are similar with other companies.. Cons: Messy. No coordination. Everyday is cleaning up mess left by other people.

Cons: The pay is terrible. It is slave labour. They don't care about the quality of your output, they need to hire new grads to create something that will pass on TV as minutely watchable and that's how they keep their expenses down.

Good networking opportunities. You meet some important people from other companies.. Cons: Archaic & completely behind the times. Production equipment is ancient. They use old computers, old versions of programs, old lighting and cameras etc. And what they say goes. Even if they're wrong, they make you feel like you're an idiot of suggesting change. Wow change. The way to evolve. If you're not chinese, be warned if you don't work for the malay or tamil channels. Open racism to non-chinese. People speak in meetings in chinese sometimes when it's an ENGLISH channel. This is ridiculous. Most people have no professionalism or ethical code of conduct. A lot of politics in promotion.If you kiss ass, you get rewarded. If you don't, then you're blacklisted. Everyone is sheep. All followers. Creativity and collaboration are crushed. You do it one way. That's it. If it's not the supervisor's way, it's wrong. Even when it's obviously the opposite. Everyone likes to do things in an old fashioned manner. Very resistant to change. Long hours. And this is not due to your ineptitude. You have to spend long hours cos other ppl are slow and it affects you. You have to stay around cos they are slow and poor at their jobs. If you leave, then it shows you don't care when in truth you could be smarter and more efficient. So while others are taking breaks, making mistakes and gossiping, you're actually doing the job well and quickly. Majority of employees are ""yes men"". So if you're smart, independent, creative and are great at what you do...tough luck. People who have been with the company longer think they know more than you even if you have an extensive resume or overseas credits. So be warned. If you're an entry level employee, expect to be treated poorly. You're just a glorified intern. Horrible pay. They pay you really poorly. It's a monopoly so they try to undercut you tremendously. If you are interviewed, ask for the salary range at once. This will give you an idea of how low it is and if you should waste your time. There is no transparency between the top, middle and lower tiers. There is always mismanagement and poor communication. The separate divisions are at odds with each other. They don't know what each other do and they all feel like their department is more important. People loose their cool and professionalism and resort to arguments and yelling. Vulgarities are common. So it's really a case of the inmates running wild. Most employees think they're special cos they work for the main broadcaster in Singapore so they talk down to people who are new. Even if you went to a much better university than them or if you have more extensive or better credits than them.
