Cons: Keep by the book, and stubborn. No room to upskill & almost no one is willing to improve for the better. Very in their own comfort zone, hence as a result very “in the box” …. Barely any creativity and very close minded. The industrial news that was received tend to be quite outdated and filtered. Though getting more open to change but, they do it in a more reluctant way. Very proud of what was not quite correct things, which these things can be done in a more effective and efficient way. Don’t know the words to use for the terms and even being corrected they still stubbornly use back what they are comfortable of. Really don’t recommend fresh grads to join as there isn’t much to learn from and they will tend to be “bully” by the “seniors” and taught the ineffective way of working. No room for improvements. Not enough seniors that can guide juniors, as some seniors were not very skilled and effective in doing things. The directions of what they looking for isn’t always clear. Though they gave references, the end results were no where near the look they asked for as most of the time they ask to make things “bigger” when their initial proposed reference were “sleek” and “simple”. All about budgeting and money… very money minded. As a result, some of the creative elements has to replaced which affects the end look. Almost ZERO communication, as a result sometimes having inconsistencies in one whole production. 1. Especially dramas, Same production yet splitting into different teams. Was told that this is to be more effective for producing the drama. However, there were different directions and inconsistencies during the shoot and ended up and always resulted in “fixing in post”. Then budgeting is another prob when “quotation” came in for “fixing in post”…. Always will needed up “no budget”. Always editors, directors, assistant directors and executive producer gave different comments which as a result have no idea who to listen to. However in the end, was told to follow EPs’ instructions. 2. In variety shows, when request for some looks/design, and due to budgeting, in-house will produce and provide them. However, when wasn’t used and was changed by other (outsource) designer/editors. The initial designer/artist was never informed about it. Then when issues appears they will blame the initial designer/artist and ask him/her make amendments accordingly. Furthermore , when there is issue they definitely won’t find what’s the problem, their 1st step of “solving” the issue was to head to the initial in-house designer/artist and point fingers at them. And demand for a solution as the deadline was tight… A lot of miscommunications and back stabbing. Has to be VERY CAREFUL OF WHAT WE SAY, always put on a “friendly” and “easy going” mask when talking to people. In general people like to put words in one’s mouth, so that to avoid being blame for wrong doings.

Cons: Poor office culture due to ""top"" heavy legacy issues whereby many VPs, SVPs, or even EVPs are irrelevant and had not been re-skilled to keep up with times especially so in areas of moving onto mobile or digital TV via multi-screens. Compensation is pathetic compared to MNCs as you're rewarded only if your boss favours you. It is not work or competency driven, it is people relations driven. Training is only for senior mgmt or VPs. Staff are often asked to pay for their own training though related to work and even asked to take their own leave to attend those work related training. Then to their shock, horror and dismay, they see their own bosses attending these conferences or training for FREE while just a couple of days ago, their request for training had been rejected or the term they like to use ""NOT SANCTIONED"" by these very own bosses of whom they just bump into at the conference or training centre. What's more appalling, these bosses would even spring a surprise on your by gate-crashing or sneaking up on you at these conferences to steal ideas/content/ citing that they're your bosses, try to associate with your network then head back to the office and write cryptic emails to you demanding for pages of report writing on the conference while you've been asked to take your own personal leave and cost for the training/seminar/conference.
