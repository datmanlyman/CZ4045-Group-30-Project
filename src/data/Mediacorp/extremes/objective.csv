They hire lots of people who have ZERO production experience or knowledge, be it old or new employees. They expect the newcomers' one week crash course is enough to equip them with the required skills. Attaching them with ""experienced"" colleagues/executive producers who are the exact arrogant ones - the exact ones who don't even know what a B-roll is - doesn't really help either.

Cons: Company keeps reorganizing and everytime they do, people quit because they are unhappy and headcount never gets replaced. And instead of promoting from within, they hire outside talent (for mgt positions) who know nothing about Mediacorp. This company is one-dimensional and reactive. When an industry competitor starts an initiative, they follow suit. Never realizing it doesn’t work for our business model. Don’t even get me started on their Merger&acquisitons dept — acquiring companies that are so unknown. Waste money and resources. Management have no idea what to do about the change of the media landscape. Instead of growing its products, it seeks revenue through outside partnerships with non-media brands, which means more work for internal staff who are already very short-handed. Again, they don’t hire extra manpower to take these projects on. You never know what you’ll be doing tomorrow: it’s shifting sands here. Management will shut down projects/depts whenever they feel like and kick employees around and make them double up. HR dept is useless. I don’t wish to elaborate. Don’t fall into the retrenchment trap here. If you don’t receive any severance within 24hrs of being made redundant, don’t expect to ever receive it. They will transfer you to a dept you hate. And if you are offered a 2mth trial in a new job role, I guarantee you won’t get severance at the end of it.

Cons: Super political at the senior management and c-suite levels. Cannot make decisions and have little foresight into the future of the company, only thinking of self preservation and power struggle. CEO has been on the job for a year now and nothing impactful has been visible. Various business groups has reorg in recent months without transparency and proper communications to entire company and creating more interfaces and problems for other business groups. Procurement and IT are a mess, nobody owns anything and everybody knows nothing. So many people acting busy, and not delivering value to the organisation and yet taichi problems to other business functions. Goals for FY are complicated and lacks transparency and accountability. Projects are messy too, complicated, under managed, in-fighting, budget overrun, delayed and still not accountability. Digital transformation is not progressing without any leadership from the CDO, whom probably does not have any digital technology experience in running such a large organisation.

She impresses indeed - comes in to the office later than anyone else, leaves earlier than 6pm on the pretext of having imaginary meetings (the person she was supposed to meet happen to be overseas ahahah!!) and goes on leave without telling anyone (did she even apply???). With a boss who is MIA, things don't get done, you have to scramble to get everything settled, sometimes even at a higher cost to get things rectified. Of course she doesn't get any blame - it's her staff (us) who gets reprimanded by the head of department for not staying on top of things. At the end of the day, your work is not even appreciated and the ones who are rewarded are those who have connections with her (yes, more recommendations from the same clique).

They're there to serve as seat warmers playing Chinese whispers passing emails while busy shopping in Zalora. The high-profile sounding, tech-related titles are being degraded because of their lack of work ethics and zero technical skill. Manager to employee ratio is 5:1. Lots of red tape to accomplish simple tasks. No avenue for career growth. You need to do self-study on new technologies. Ideas will be swayed or unacknowledged, initiatives/proactivity will be met with lots of questioning. Very dependent on part-time staff. Petty change pay raises. Way below industry standard pay, yet they expect you to perform as a full-stack/all-around developer.

They use old computers, old versions of programs, old lighting and cameras etc. And what they say goes. Even if they're wrong, they make you feel like you're an idiot of suggesting change. Wow change. The way to evolve. If you're not chinese, be warned if you don't work for the malay or tamil channels. Open racism to non-chinese. People speak in meetings in chinese sometimes when it's an ENGLISH channel. This is ridiculous. Most people have no professionalism or ethical code of conduct. A lot of politics in promotion.If you kiss ass, you get rewarded. If you don't, then you're blacklisted. Everyone is sheep. All followers. Creativity and collaboration are crushed. You do it one way. That's it. If it's not the supervisor's way, it's wrong. Even when it's obviously the opposite. Everyone likes to do things in an old fashioned manner. Very resistant to change. Long hours. And this is not due to your ineptitude. You have to spend long hours cos other ppl are slow and it affects you. You have to stay around cos they are slow and poor at their jobs. If you leave, then it shows you don't care when in truth you could be smarter and more efficient. So while others are taking breaks, making mistakes and gossiping, you're actually doing the job well and quickly. Majority of employees are ""yes men"". So if you're smart, independent, creative and are great at what you do...tough luck. People who have been with the company longer think they know more than you even if you have an extensive resume or overseas credits. So be warned. If you're an entry level employee, expect to be treated poorly. You're just a glorified intern. Horrible pay. They pay you really poorly. It's a monopoly so they try to undercut you tremendously. If you are interviewed, ask for the salary range at once. This will give you an idea of how low it is and if you should waste your time. There is no transparency between the top, middle and lower tiers. There is always mismanagement and poor communication. The separate divisions are at odds with each other. They don't know what each other do and they all feel like their department is more important. People loose their cool and professionalism and resort to arguments and yelling. Vulgarities are common. So it's really a case of the inmates running wild. Most employees think they're special cos they work for the main broadcaster in Singapore so they talk down to people who are new. Even if you went to a much better university than them or if you have more extensive or better credits than them.
