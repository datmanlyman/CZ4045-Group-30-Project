211,211,Dyson,2021-05-31,Steer away from this company if you wish to grow! One of the good for nothing company to work for,1.0,"Pros: Only Pro is really good salary & incentive structures during season period. But that's also a con, more on it in cons segment. Employee discount is one of the best but who cares as their products have become the worst quality that requires maintenance & service every 6 months. What good is a product if it doesn't function without issues. Yearly increments are upto the mark.. Cons: The list is huge!! 1) No Work Life Balance - They expect you to work 24x7, at least according to the Customer service Director. You get constant calls on your day off (week-day) asking for queries and requesting to take up a cx call just because it's escalated! All meetings are scheduled on your week off and you are expected to join them! That too at 8:30AM in the morning! Who sets an official meeting at 8:30 AM when the working hours are from 9:30 AM thay too on a day when so many are on off? If you don't join the meeting, you are constantly called upon on your phone to attend the meeting by your manager,. The meeting lasts for 5 minutes with only good for nothing data discussed. You'all share Pulsey survey regularly on how to improve Work Life balance, but what implementation is done? 2) You don't get Sundays as week off, I mean come on! All services are over video call now, and they think customers will return back the machine if they don't get service on Sunday! The customers can wait a day if they are informed properly! The Director sets an example from his initial days of starting work that we have to be available all the time as this ensure we grow in our careers. He says that we used to hog our back off, roaming on bikes & public transport to service customers. Oh come on, times have changed, so has quality of service provided. The only thing that hasn't changed is the Old man mentality of management. 3) Inexperienced Managers: The company exploits a lot of fresh out of the boat graduates, and hog them to work round the clock as the company knows that they are paying good money and get the employees to work like slaves. Immediate team managers are just promoted doesn't know anything with lot of ego issues. They expect you to do anything they ask for, including micro-managing their work when they are in-efficient in managing. Managers do not know how to manage a team and they think we owe our lives & time to the company. Things used to be much better during the initial launch of the company. But now, with so many efficient people left, especially Rana, the company's standards & quality have gone down the drain. 4) Promotions: Don't expect promotions until 2 years, and even if you get promoted the job description is the same. Why have a promotion then? Your appraisals are solely based on biased feedback from managers and KPI doesn't matter anything. Only petty politics & favourable people get promoted. Even if you achieve your goals, it's never high enough for the company. 5) Contact center team is one of the worst in the industry. Insufficiently trained & brought live & direct to work. And they mess up big time, you end up doing half their work. For every repair call, they add ESCALATED. 6) This is one of the worst companies to work for. There's no growth even when you achieve all KPI's. Your manager, who used to be Field Service Engineer first thinks that we are working in this company for the our own good. Little does he know that we are working for the betterment of the company at the same time. Novice manager, with ego issues, no clear communication provided and withholds information that needs to be circulated. Incorrect Job Descriptions: Service Engineers? Really? Should have named the title - Demonstration Technicians. B.Tech graduates are meant to attend video demonstrations of Dyson products to owners? Why? Why not save up money and hire non B.tech graduates? How do you expects employees to stay and work up the ladder when there's no opportunity to grow? Service is just a mislead here.

Reported issues regarding exclusion are often met with responses such as ‚Äú(S)he is such a nice person! Everyone loves him/her! I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not what they meant‚Äù. Often, reports go un-responded to. Inclusion must go further than ‚ÄúInternational Women‚Äôs Day‚Äù to be fully inclusive. No Process ‚Äì Lack of process has resulted in organizational silos being built, and it has reinforced unaccountability. Blaming and finger-pointing are commonplace, with many people saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù Without process, we don‚Äôt know how well or bad we are doing. We can‚Äôt measure our efficiencies or if we are reaching our goal. This is why we are perpetually fighting fires at PAC. No strategy ‚Äì Reorgs, restructures, and layoffs are routine at Panasonic Avionics. When changes are made, it is not communicated as to what we are trying to accomplish through those changes. Lack of processes results in the inability to gauge the effectiveness of the changes. Working without strategy creates the illusion of change without anything being accomplished. Imagine a team of 3-year old‚Äôs playing soccer. Things are happening on the field, and nothing is being accomplished. The fire fighting continues. The absence of vision from leadership has contributed to the lack of process and strategy. Without a clear vision, we are not sure what we are working towards. What are we trying to accomplish at PAC? Vision provides a direction of an overarching when we know what direction we are moving in. We can set a path in that direction by monitoring and measuring success through process and feedback. Panasonic Avionics is adrift and rudderless without vision. Careless leadership ‚Äì in a recorded address to the company last June, the CEO announced that a second round of significant layoffs would be taking place that day. In the same breath, he announced our CTO‚Äôs hiring from Netflix and that we would be moving to a newly renovated campus once it was safe again. While hiring a new CTO and a new campus is exciting, announcing it in conjunction with layoffs was cruel and displayed a gross lapse in empathy, emotional intelligence, and grace. Change adverse ‚Äì Maintaining the status quo is valued and exemplified at the highest levels of leadership. In a meeting with a Vice President, an idea to create a training initiative that would support a career advancement program was brought up. Without missing a beat, the VP said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea, but that‚Äôs a paradigm shift, and we don‚Äôt have time for that.‚Äù There is a lot of talk about things that ‚Äúshould change‚Äù and ‚Äúcould make a difference,‚Äù but no action is ever taken. This adversity to change has stunted innovation at PAC. ‚ÄúInnovations‚Äù that have been touted recently at PAC should be recognized as a capitulation to market demands rather than innovation. At this point, PAC is surviving on inertia alone. There is fear to speak truth to power at PAC. In one of our last in-person all-hands meetings, an employee stood up and said that he did not have the tools and network access he needed to do his job. He was unable to correct issues that were costing significant time and money. Despite having gone through the correct channels, the employee could not gain access to the tools he needed to be successful. One of the executives on the stage roasted the employee, telling him exactly why he couldn‚Äôt get access to the tools he needed and that he would ‚Äúneed to figure it out.‚Äù At that moment, it was demonstrated by leadership that it was not safe to speak truth to power, even if it is to ask for help. More disappointing was that no other executive standing on that stage tried to intervene. This fear to speak truth to power keeps employees from asking questions, making suggestions, or even giving a complete picture or assessment of any given situation that may be less than optimal. Employees are taken for granted. The CEO and a VP announced the ‚ÄúPanasonic Avionics Excellence Awards.‚Äù The first time an award would be given to recognize the top 10 performing teams at PAC, with some impressive prizes going to the top 3 teams. The top 10 teams were announced, then the top three teams were announced, and then nothing, just silence. Hardworking and engaged teams go unappreciated regularly at PAC. We still don‚Äôt know who the winners were. Not following through on something as simple as saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is a failure of leadership and accountability at a fundamental level. Career advancement is not a straightforward process at Panasonic Avionics unless you‚Äôre well connected. Nepotism ensures that the easiest way to be promoted within the organization is through relationships. There is no guidance on what it takes to move from a level one position to a level 2 position or beyond. Most job descriptions for the different levels are the same, and the leveling is primarily based upon one‚Äôs rate of pay. Beyond that, no one understands what skill sets are necessary to move up in the organization beyond knowing the right people. Leadership refuses to listen when team members provide input. Over the past year and a half, we have been asked to provide our inputs to ‚ÄúCulture Surveys‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmployee Opinion Surveys.‚Äù Results from such surveys are either statistically incorrect, painting a rosier picture than what is taking place in actuality, or results are never shared at all. In either case, no action plans to address issues that are communicated through surveys are ever put into place, and our opinions and inputs are ignored. Asking for one‚Äôs opinion and then not acknowledging it appears disingenuous and inauthentic. It‚Äôs important to remember that leaders who refuse to listen will ultimately be surrounded by people who have nothing to say. Culture of unaccountability ‚Äì The issues that have been mentioned above point to a company with leadership that says one thing and demonstrates the opposite. Leaders have spoken publicly and eloquently about the importance of ‚ÄúGrit and Grace.‚Äù Still, grit is easily overlooked because of nepotism, and grace is absent from the highest level of leadership. Executives have spoken about the importance of mentorship in building strong leaders within an organization but have made no effort to encourage mentorship at PAC. Talks on the importance of gratitude have been given, yet leadership couldn‚Äôt be bothered to complete an effort to recognize highly engaged teams. Accountability isn‚Äôt achieved in the words that we say, but rather in the actions we take towards making those words a reality. It isn‚Äôt easy to trust and respect those who talk the talk but don‚Äôt walk the walk.",Anonymous Employee,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,en,"['Pros', ':', 'Exciting', 'industry',

i was working with no contract for three months because no body knew how long to extend my contract for, because HR could not get hold of their employee who was my line manager. - promises to pay for your training but will give someone else the opportunity - because that someone else is Korean, for e.g; they gave Agile training to a staff who was there temporarily and was an exchange student and refused to give it to their permanent staff who wanted to grow, and this was not done discreetly. - they are very hot on mental health but apart from giving you free access to Headspace the Mediating App they don't actually implement practices to make the work space less stressful - HR and Finance team are extremely weak, unorganised, blasé and unreliable - for Digital Agency everything moves very slow - Lastly, if you are not Korean, be prepared to feel unappreciated, uncomfortable, awkward and dispensable.",Team and Project Assistant,"Southwark, England",reviews,subjective,negative,en,"['Pros', ':', '-', 'really', 'good', 'and', 'intelligent', 'colleagues', '-', 'tries', 'to', 'be', 'inclusive', 'and', 'integrated', '-', 'FREE', 'yoga', 'class', '-', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'free', 'time', 'at', 'work', '-', 'You', 'basically', 'work', 'for', 'Samsung', 'and', 'that', 'looks', 'very', 'impressive', 'on', 'your', 'CV', '.', 'Cons', ':', '-', 'high', 'level', 'management', 'talk', 'over', 'you', 'in', 'Korean', 'all', 'the', 'time', 'in', 'meetings', 'without', 'explaining', 'what', 'is', 'happening', '-', 'extremely', 'unorganised', '-', 'there', 'is', 'this', 'weird', 'awkwardness', 'borderline', 'rivalry', 'within', 'the', 'company', 'against', 'people', 'from', 'the', '1st', 'floor', 'and', '3rd', 'floor', '-', 'no', 'creativity', 'is', 'manifested', 'here', ',', 'everything', 'is', 'spoon', 'fed', 'and', 'chewed', 'from', 'Korea', 'for', 'us', 'to', 'swallow', 'aka', 'PUBLISH', '-', 'a', 'digital', 'agency', 'with', 'software', 'older', 'than', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', ';', 'actual', 'hard', 'copies', 'of', 'invoices', 'are', 'saved', 'in', 'files', 'despite', 'being', 'a', 'DIGITAL', 'AGENCY', '-', 'No', '1-2-', '1', 'with', 'line', 'manager', 'because', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'about', 'your', 'growth', 'unless', 'you', 'are', 'from', 'Korea', '-', 'No', 'one', 'is', 'racist', 'there', 'but', 'you', 'will', 'feel', 'like', 'a', 'victim', 'of', 'racism', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'not', 'Korean', '-', 'they', 'will', 'tell', 'you', 'you', 'are', 'incompetent', 'and', 'inexperienced', 'without', 'ever', 'having', 'a', 'review', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'will', 'promote', 'people', 'because', 'they', 'are', 'korean', '(', 'i', 'worked', 'there', 'for', 'over', 'a', 'year', 'and', 'half', 'and', 'had', 'one', 'review', 'to', 'say', 'i', 'passed', 'my', 'probation', 'that', 'also', 'a', 'month', 'later', ')', '-', 'over', '90', '%', 'jobs', 'are', 'all', 'contracts', 'and', 'they', 'never', 'review', 'your', 'contract', 'on', 'time', 'unless', 'you', 'keep', 'pestering', 'them', ',', 'eg', ';', 'i', 'was', 'working', 'with', 'no', 'contract', 'for', 'three', 'months', 'because', 'no', 'body', 'knew', 'how', 'long', 'to', 'extend', 'my', 'contract', 'for', ',', 'because', 'HR', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'hold', 'of', 'their', 'employee', 'who', 'was', 'my', 'line', 'manager', '.', '-', 'promises', 'to', 'pay', 'for', 'your', 'training', 'but', 'will', 'give', 'someone', 'else', 'the', 'opportunity', '-', 'because', 'that', 'someone', 'else', 'is', 'Korean', ',', 'for', 'e', '.', 'g', ';', 'they', 'gave', 'Agile', 'training', 'to', 'a', 'staff', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'temporarily', 'and', 'was', 'an', 'exchange', 'student', 'and', 'refused', 'to', 'give', 'it', 'to', 'their', 'permanent', 'staff', 'who', 'wanted', 'to', 'grow', ',', 'and', 'this', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'discreetly', '.', '-', 'they', 'are', 'very', 'hot', 'on', 'mental', 'health', 'but', 'apart', 'from', 'giving', 'you', 'free', 'access', 'to', 'Headspace', 'the', 'Mediating', 'App', 'they', ""don't"", 'actually', 'implement', 'practices', 'to', 'make', 'the', 'work', 'space', 'less', 'stressful', '-', 'HR', 'and', 'Finance', 'team', 'are', 'extremely', 'weak', ',', 'unorganised', ',', 'blasé', 'and', 'unreliable', '-', 'for', 'Digital', 'Agency', 'everything', 'moves', 'very', 'slow', '-', 'Lastly', ',', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'not', 'Korean', ',', 'be', 'prepared', 'to', 'feel', 'unappreciated', ',', 'uncomfortable', ',', 'awkward', 'and', 'dispensable', '.']",,,,

Cons: Keep by the book, and stubborn. No room to upskill & almost no one is willing to improve for the better. Very in their own comfort zone, hence as a result very “in the box” …. Barely any creativity and very close minded. The industrial news that was received tend to be quite outdated and filtered. Though getting more open to change but, they do it in a more reluctant way. Very proud of what was not quite correct things, which these things can be done in a more effective and efficient way. Don’t know the words to use for the terms and even being corrected they still stubbornly use back what they are comfortable of. Really don’t recommend fresh grads to join as there isn’t much to learn from and they will tend to be “bully” by the “seniors” and taught the ineffective way of working. No room for improvements. Not enough seniors that can guide juniors, as some seniors were not very skilled and effective in doing things. The directions of what they looking for isn’t always clear. Though they gave references, the end results were no where near the look they asked for as most of the time they ask to make things “bigger” when their initial proposed reference were “sleek” and “simple”. All about budgeting and money… very money minded. As a result, some of the creative elements has to replaced which affects the end look. Almost ZERO communication, as a result sometimes having inconsistencies in one whole production. 1. Especially dramas, Same production yet splitting into different teams. Was told that this is to be more effective for producing the drama. However, there were different directions and inconsistencies during the shoot and ended up and always resulted in “fixing in post”. Then budgeting is another prob when “quotation” came in for “fixing in post”…. Always will needed up “no budget”. Always editors, directors, assistant directors and executive producer gave different comments which as a result have no idea who to listen to. However in the end, was told to follow EPs’ instructions. 2. In variety shows, when request for some looks/design, and due to budgeting, in-house will produce and provide them. However, when wasn’t used and was changed by other (outsource) designer/editors. The initial designer/artist was never informed about it. Then when issues appears they will blame the initial designer/artist and ask him/her make amendments accordingly. Furthermore , when there is issue they definitely won’t find what’s the problem, their 1st step of “solving” the issue was to head to the initial in-house designer/artist and point fingers at them. And demand for a solution as the deadline was tight… A lot of miscommunications and back stabbing. Has to be VERY CAREFUL OF WHAT WE SAY, always put on a “friendly” and “easy going” mask when talking to people.

He surrounds himself with people who feeds him with validation instead of good ideas. • Culture of Dishonesty - This company is built on a web of lies and admittedly strong marketing.

849,849,Dyson,2022-05-03,"challenging, rewarding and supported by really great people who care",5.0,"Pros: - The innovative and collaborative culture is quite unique in a company of Dyson's size and is something I have only seen before in small start-ups. This makes it a really great place to work. - Dyson is very good at hiring smart people who want to work together and help others to learn and develop. I came for the technology but have stayed for the people. - The focus on building the best product possible for our users and being prepared to really invest in that is something which I love as a product person. - We are starting to embrace more flexible working in the software engineering functions now post covid, which is really helping with the work life balance and collaboration across timezones. - As it is still run very much like a start-up there are loads of opportunities for real autonomy, particularly if you are prepared to break some rules (which is often encouraged and supported) - The problems that we have to solve are often technically very hard and have not been done before which is great - Change is a constant at Dyson and we are not scared to make large changes which means you don't get stuck in rut. These changes are often good, but even when they are not you don't have to wait long for it to change again for the better!. Cons: - As it is a start-up which has grown quickly there are quite a few supporting functions and procedures which haven't kept a pace with this. There are some growing pains still to go through but the trick will be to ensure that we still keep the nimble ways of working too. - The need to keep our IP as secret as possible has lead to an unconscious lack of sharing between engineering and other functions even when they are not discussing anything secret. This is something we need to get better at. - More flexible working has not been adopted company wide yet. - The split between New Product Innovation and New Product Delivery isn't ideal, but this is a hard balancing act. How do you give people enough space to truly innovate without having to support getting a product into production, yet still learning all the lessons so your next product is better. We seem to be iterating to a better place though. - Being an entirely privately owned company the executive team do not have as much autonomy as in some public companies. However, this is offset by real investment into the long term rather than shorter term goals. - For me the pros far and away out-way the cons",Senior Product Manager,"Hullavington, England",reviews,subjective,positive,en,"['Pros', ':', '-', 'The', 'innovative', 'and', 'collaborative', 'culture', 'is', 'quite', 'unique', 'in', 'a', 'company', 'of', ""Dyson's"", 'size', 'and', 'is', 'something', 'I', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'before', 'in', 'small', 'start-ups', '.', 'This', 'makes', 'it', 'a', 'really', 'great', 'place', 'to', 'work', '.', '-', 'Dyson', 'is', 'very', 'good', 'at', 'hiring', 'smart', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'to', 'work', 'together', 'and', 'help', 'others', 'to', 'learn', 'and', 'develop', '.', 'I', 'came', 'for', 'the', 'technology', 'but', 'have', 'stayed', 'for', 'the', 'people', '.', '-', 'The', 'focus', 'on', 'building', 'the', 'best', 'product', 'possible', 'for', 'our', 'users', 'and', 'being', 'prepared', 'to', 'really', 'invest', 'in', 'that', 'is', 'something', 'which', 'I', 'love', 'as', 'a', 'product', 'person', '.', '-', 'We', 'are', 'starting', 'to', 'embrace', 'more', 'flexible', 'working', 'in', 'the', 'software', 'engineering', 'functions', 'now', 'post', 'covid', ',', 'which', 'is', 'really', 'helping', 'with', 'the', 'work', 'life', 'balance', 'and', 'collaboration', 'across', 'timezones', '.', '-', 'As', 'it', 'is', 'still', 'run', 'very', 'much', 'like', 'a', 'start-up', 'there', 'are', 'loads', 'of', 'opportunities', 'for', 'real', 'autonomy', ',', 'particularly', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'prepared', 'to', 'break', 'some', 'rules', '(', 'which', 'is', 'often', 'encouraged', 'and', 'supported', ')', '-', 'The', 'problems', 'that', 'we', 'have', 'to', 'solve', 'are', 'often', 'technically', 'very', 'hard', 'and', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'which', 'is', 'great', '-', 'Change', 'is', 'a', 'constant', 'at', 'Dyson', 'and', 'we', 'are', 'not', 'scared', 'to', 'make', 'large', 'changes', 'which', 'means', 'you', ""don't"", 'get', 'stuck', 'in', 'rut', '.', 'These', 'changes', 'are', 'often', 'good', ',', 'but', 'even', 'when', 'they', 'are', 'not', 'you', ""don't"", 'have', 'to', 'wait', 'long', 'for', 'it', 'to', 'change', 'again', 'for', 'the', 'better', '!', '.', 'Cons', ':', '-', 'As', 'it', 'is', 'a', 'start-up', 'which', 'has', 'grown', 'quickly', 'there', 'are', 'quite', 'a', 'few', 'supporting', 'functions', 'and', 'procedures', 'which', ""haven't"", 'kept', 'a', 'pace', 'with', 'this', '.', 'There', 'are', 'some', 'growing', 'pains', 'still', 'to', 'go', 'through', 'but', 'the', 'trick', 'will', 'be', 'to', 'ensure', 'that', 'we', 'still', 'keep', 'the', 'nimble', 'ways', 'of', 'working', 'too', '.', '-', 'The', 'need', 'to', 'keep', 'our', 'IP', 'as', 'secret', 'as', 'possible', 'has', 'lead', 'to', 'an', 'unconscious', 'lack', 'of', 'sharing', 'between', 'engineering', 'and', 'other', 'functions', 'even', 'when', 'they', 'are', 'not', 'discussing', 'anything', 'secret', '.', 'This', 'is', 'something', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'get', 'better', 'at', '.', '-', 'More', 'flexible', 'working', 'has', 'not', 'been', 'adopted', 'company', 'wide', 'yet', '.', '-', 'The', 'split', 'between', 'New', 'Product', 'Innovation', 'and', 'New', 'Product', 'Delivery', ""isn't"", 'ideal', ',', 'but', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'hard', 'balancing', 'act', '.', 'How', 'do', 'you', 'give', 'people', 'enough', 'space', 'to', 'truly', 'innovate', 'without', 'having', 'to', 'support', 'getting', 'a', 'product', 'into', 'production', ',', 'yet', 'still', 'learning', 'all', 'the', 'lessons', 'so', 'your', 'next', 'product', 'is', 'better', '.', 'We', 'seem', 'to', 'be', 'iterating', 'to', 'a', 'better', 'place', 'though', '.', '-', 'Being', 'an', 'entirely', 'privately', 'owned', 'company', 'the', 'executive', 'team', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'autonomy', 'as', 'in', 'some', 'public', 'companies', '.', 'However', ',', 'this', 'is', 'offset', 'by', 'real', 'investment', 'into', 'the', 'long', 'term', 'rather', 'than', 'shorter', 'term', 'goals', '.', '-', 'For', 'me', 'the', 'pros', 'far', 'and', 'away', 'out-way', 'the', 'cons']",,,,

You're better off elsewhere. Promotions and benefits are not well design to reward achievements neither are promotions announced at all. Lots of strange HR policies that are bureaucratic that doesn't apply to current employment standards. Very government in nature. However, too much self-inflicted censorship and pain. This company's HR policies is designed to protect the company and NOT for STAFF GROWTH.. Cons: Poor office culture due to ""top"" heavy legacy issues whereby many VPs, SVPs, or even EVPs are irrelevant and had not been re-skilled to keep up with times especially so in areas of moving onto mobile or digital TV via multi-screens. Compensation is pathetic compared to MNCs as you're rewarded only if your boss favours you. It is not work or competency driven, it is people relations driven. Training is only for senior mgmt or VPs. Staff are often asked to pay for their own training though related to work and even asked to take their own leave to attend those work related training. Then to their shock, horror and dismay, they see their own bosses attending these conferences or training for FREE while just a couple of days ago, their request for training had been rejected or the term they like to use ""NOT SANCTIONED"" by these very own bosses of whom they just bump into at the conference or training centre. What's more appalling, these bosses would even spring a surprise on your by gate-crashing or sneaking up on you at these conferences to steal ideas/content/ citing that they're your bosses, try to associate with your network then head back to the office and write cryptic emails to you demanding for pages of report writing on the conference while you've been asked to take your own personal leave and cost for the training/seminar/conference.

932,932,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,2013-08-08,"An environment rife with scapegoating, misconduct, employee mistreatment, lack of reward, lack of respect",1.0,"Pros: -. Cons: Panasonic is a terrible work environment, driven solely by politics, pure and simple. If you're even considering it, I strongly suggest you contact anyone who has left there. Employees are overloaded with work, provided with unrealistic time-frames that aren't feasible or humane, and should anything go wrong they are scapegoated and vilified. Raises happen rarely, and not based on merit. Cronyism isn't just rampant, it's the norm and they act as though it's typical business practice. The negative impact of it probably creates the most problems at Panasonic, because severe errors made by management are never dealt with and get repeated while the worst of people are rewarded. The people who work the hardest never move and the salaries for engineers are capped by level. The company makes great sounding plans, then works as hard as it can to destroy the product by being careless and at the same time blaming anyone and everyone in sight. I don't know anybody there in engineering who is happy, and the people I knew who left were ecstatic. Panasonic is a corporate nightmare, with few scruples and even less interest in recognizing dedication and the value of people. I saw the same pattern for years; people were paid a half-decent wage in the beginning, had some successes while they thought it was a moderately fair place, then after relentless antagonism from management and the blame game, their spirit slowly crumbled as more unrealistic feats were expected without proper resources or recognition being provided. They were lulled into staying because of the economy and because they didn't care much about a positive work environment anymore. They lost hope. Many turned -heavily- to alcohol. They eventually became so experienced that it didn't phase them as much, but were never treated any better and never given the resources and support that would have provided them with a fair, structured, comfortable work life. Moreover, the company always made it harder and harder to get the exact same job done which made the same job increasingly more stressful. I'm leaving out a lot, but trust me, you will find out within 1.5 - 2 years time how big of a mistake you made joining Panasonic. Survival Tips (but please reconsider): If you want to survive there, you'll need to make a lot of friends in every department. If you leave a door open for them to target you/blame you/use you and have no political protection, they will do so gladly. You can work very hard and never get promoted, or just do a mediocre but not totally useless job and probably get promoted if you never make waves. If you get overloaded with work, make sure you tell your manager you need assistance or perception will be that you have a total handle on things. Do not bother with HR unless you have a legal case, they will not react. Most of all, do not be weak with Panasonic. They (management) have no interest in you or your happiness. They want you to be successful, to make their department look 100x better than other departments (it's that competitive) and overcome all the obstacles management has created without saying ""I didn't have the information"" or ""there wasn't time because this is a complex product and the schedule doesn't work"". Most people who leave Panasonic are fired with their reputations ruined, luckily this didn't happen to me, but happened to many good people I knew who (by the end) thought themselves utterly

965,965,Mapletree Investments,2017-07-17,Avoid if you can,1.0,"Pros: Pay is slightly higher, but that is probably to compensate you for the toxic culture. Cons: Think of the red tape that government sector has, and the corporate politics that the private sector has, merge the two and that’s Mapletree. The other reviews aren’t exaggerating. Generally, departments work in silos and politics is widespread here. If you choose not to play, you are likely going to end up as roadkill in the process. I will not elaborate on how toxic the culture is here since my colleagues/ex-colleagues have elaborated in detail here. What I will say is, this place is good for those who are very skilled at playing politics. This is your playground. And for those who have no choice but to join, this is my advice to you: 1. Tread with care. Yes men thrive here so do not ever question your bosses. 2. Don’t be too nice. Once you are identified as a target, you will be the punching bag that people use to release their stress. Bosses do shout at their employees here, and other department’s colleagues sometimes shout at you too. I’ve heard f-words being hurled around. Try not to take that to heart or appear like you can be easily bullied. 3. Try to become the in-crowd. If you’re not part of the in-crowd, you’re ostracized and bullied. There are a lot of single fresh graduates here and it is part of the culture to work long hours, so those with families and kids think twice and try to manage it. You may have to stay around for face-time a few times a week in order to be part of that in-crowd. 4. Improve your political skills. Somehow. 5. And most importantly, do not ever trust your boss or the people around you. You can be tossed out as the by-product of a political battle anytime. Be really really careful here. Long story short is, if you have no choice but to join, think carefully about whether it is worth it to lose your soul to this company and possibly be so damaged that you need counselling help.

Want your boss to be texting your personal number every day you’re off asking if you can “just help out a few extra hours”? Then this is the place. Want to work for a company that says you’ll get sales bonuses and great pay, but fails to tell you you’ll also be taking 4-6 tech support chats at a time that will give you horrible reviews making you ineligible for any bonus? Then this is the place. Seriously it’s bad. Everyone just lies to their customer to tell them what we they want so they leave them a good review and they can get a bonus, then if you’re the poor chum that gets the customer next and have to tell them the previous agent was incorrect; guess who’s getting a bad score? Yup you are. Also they tell you it’s easy to make a bonus since it’s all based on your scores that guest give you. But they don’t tell you it’s on a 0-10 scale and while you need to make a 78 for a bonus that if anyone gives you a 0 that score is actually super weighted and tanks your entire month. So even if you get 40 people to give you a perfect 10 aka a 100% and you get one upset guest whose mad at someone else setting the wrong expectations or something way out of your control; if they give you a 0 there goes your entire months bonus.

In addition, every colleague in the company is very friendly, and there has never been any unpleasant things between us. The company often organizes tours,,various sports clubs, etc., also prepares birthday gifts and holiday gifts for us. Leaders are very nice.. Cons: overtime is definitely inevitable.

5173,5173,ST Engineering,11/9/2022,You deserve better,1.0,"Pros: 1. Good colleagues but it also depends the department you are working in. 2. These go both ways, if you are lucky, you will get a Reporting Officer (RO) who doesn't care about you, Hence, no micromanagement.. Cons: 1. Senior management have the mentality of ""My ideas always worked before"" and ""I know what the customers truly wants"" attitudes, does not listen to any of the actual employees that are working on the ground. 2. Salary is not competitive versus the market. 3. As a senior staff, you are expected to hold appointments in 3-4 projects at one time. The management will tasked the existing staff to take over any ""leftovers"" from the ones who left without the intention of hiring more manpower to reduce workload. 4. The management expects you to be overworked as it is common in the company and does not believe in giving you a better ""salary package"". 5. The management also does not believe in providing opportunities for the junior staff unless they are scholars. So if you are not ""first class honours"", progression will be real slow for you even if you met your KPIs. That being said, don't expect a super fast progression if you are first class. 6. Not really a major con but bosses like to come in 5-10 mins before your work day ends for meetings, so those rushing to fetch their kids, do note. 7. Micromanagement (only if you are that lucky enough to get an RO who is super into every single moves you made) 8. Decisions and changes from management takes about average 5-6 months to process. 9. On the ground engineers, I'm sorry but it is a fact that you won't be valued as much as those working at main office. (If you are not seen by the bosses, you are not contributing as much) 10.

Cons: - Management plays favorites & doesn't use your full potential unless you are a suck up. Otherwise, you are seen as disposable. - It's really hard to grow here and the Talent Development team doesn't help with your career path and stay stuck in the same role for 5 years. I've consistently reached out to my management and HR for ways for career growth but I was always pushed to the side. - Salary ranges are questionable for the type of work that is done. It's also questionable how management decides the salary for certain criteria. - Leadership and its direction is constantly changing so it's hard for the company to be cohesive and have trust with their employees. - H R always directs you to someone else who also doesn't know how to help you and you get stuck in an uneducated loop until you decide to pull in their manager. - It's really hard to feel important at this company especially with leadership that has no idea what you do on a day-to-day basis.",Anonymous Employee,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.8141,0.07845805,positive,positive

As long as you have worked there for sometime and know the key people you are okay. 4) All the key management folks who have been there for quite some time have been pushed out and DirectTV management folks have thronged here and they don't have a clue how to run an avionics company. Plain sad. 5) Since they hired a lot of these upper management folks with mega salaries, Christmas parties among others perks have been cut to fund them, I think. 6) Management promises certain things and doesn't fulfill them. 7) Not a good company for people who need H1-B's/GC's. New policy is no sponsorship. Even if they sponsor for certain individuals, you would have to pay them out of your pocket. So watch out, they work only with their lawyers!!

The most immature engineering department that I have ever met in my life, filled with engineering managers who just fight with each other and develop contradicting technologies. Everything is a turf war, and they develop middle layers just for the sake of developing middle layers to control each other. Most engineering managers (except a few), are not technical enough / have the balls to facilitate technologies debates. 2. I guess this is not just the engineering department. All departments don't communicate with each other and hate each other. Sometimes the managers hate each other so much, they teach their team members to hate the members of the other team. So you are ""guilty by association"", when it's absolutely critical that the teams work together. In the end, the customer and the business suffers because of these turf wars. 3. The sad thing is that, I realized that if these managers actually communicate properly with each other, they will find that their interests are actually aligned. Poor communication creates false assumptions with results in unproductive hate of each other. 4. Management culture is toxic where favoritism trumps reasoning. 5. The are so many questionable hires at key positions, that results in the rare good employees feel like a ""slap in the face"". 6. Ok, so if you are not experienced, I would still respect you if you are willing to learn from mistakes and willing to change. However, that is not the case, there seems to be no intention to change the practice. And managers just crosses their fingers, closes their eyes, procrastinate on the problem, and hope that the problems will go away. A key example is that managers are absolutely adamant about sticking to the ""process"", when they themselves believe that the ""process is broken / not sufficient"".

Headcount continues to drop at an alarming rate, and there is little or no effort to replace leavers, causing those left behind extremely disgruntled and disillusioned. 2. Base salary is so much lower than the market rate that without significant bonus to make up for this, the low total remuneration will not attract or keep any talent. 3. Staff morale is at an all-time low. Most seem to look forward to a good retrenchment package after the anticipated merger with Sembcorp than to a good career growth in the company. No one believes in the latter anymore. 4.

Now that new orders are drying up and some owners are delaying rig delivery, maybe there's no need to keep rushing. I might be wrong, because management can still rush you even if there's no need to. Calculate how much time did you spend to earn the good money, you'll see why it only looks good on the surface. Strict one hour lunch break gets converted into punchlist/lunch/shouting meeting. No chance for even a short breather. Pointless whatsapp groups. 1 project, more 10 groups. Messages comes in consistently. Phone calls every 5 minutes.

7599,7599,Integrated Health Information Systems,3/7/2021,Unprofessional incompetent management and useless HR,1.0,"Pros: There's always work to do for healthcare, so you can never get retrenched Hard to get fired due to lame management and HR, so you have a job for life. Cons: It's amazing the holes from which people are hired to take up management positions up to senior director levels. They may have been in senior positions in their previous jobs, but surely existing IHiS management should be more stringent in the hiring process so that vacancies aren't filled by unprofessional incompetent useless bums. Yet it's so easy for any old subpar bum to get the job, and remain in it even though the top levels of management are the ROs of these bums and know that they aren't performing but throwing everything to their subordinates. There are so many ineffective figures in management who play taichi the whole day and who gallavant around Singapore during office hours enjoying life, instead of taking ownership and doing real work. You'd think their conscience would call out to them, because their salary comes from taxpayers' money. Nope. Many of these same bums are also rude and oppressive towards their subordinates and junior staff. And they often hire people who are just as incompetent with crap non-team player attitudes, and the ""virus"" spreads. So you know what happens? The good people get frustrated and quit, and the lousy ones stay on and multiply. HR does not care and will not help you. There are wayang initiatives like birthday vouchers, CSR initiatives and IHiS academy and what not, but if you can't even treat people decently and fairly and ensure people are treated decently and fairly, what's the point? It's amusing and disgusting at the same time how some HR people think they are so capable, and they go for coaching courses thinking they are now some expert on people development, when they can't even get the basics right. IHiS published some FB post telling staff that if they feel distressed they can call their HR business partner. Yet when staff do that, they get told things like they should be grateful they have a job, or that if they didn't do anything wrong they shouldn't worry. I tell my colleagues to forget about HR and just call the SOS hotline. When IHiS needs you, the bosses may still be somewhat polite. After you tender, be prepared for them to be nasty, throwing hurdles your way, making you jump through hoops, gaslighting you and sucking you dry till you leave. They may say/promise you one thing, but don't expect anyone to keep their word. Don't expect any gratitude for any OT you put in before you tendered, and while you are serving notice. I know of many colleagues who sacrificed their health and time with their family, and who had fights with their spouses because of work overload and pressure from bosses. They worked while on medical/hospitalisation leave, or didn't take medical leave. Their annual leave got forfeited, and their bosses refused to give them time off in lieu. Management may wayang a bit, but make no mistake, management does not give a crap.

Some others mismanage their department and play favourites, allow disgusting bad behaviour to continue. Many PMs hate to work with someone in legal department who is famous for being rude and shouting at vendors and even own colleagues. Still can get promoted. What does it say about ihis? That bad behaviour is ok, even encouraged and rewarded. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many incompetent people at AD, DD and D levels. Some cannot even form proper sentences in English and everyone wonders what they are talking about. They don't even know what they are doing. When they are asked questions they ask their staff, and respond using their staff's answers under their own name. What a joke. Top of the top management doesn't even know, or maybe doesn't care.

There is also barely any communication with the staff so you essentially have to adapt to every politically-motivated decision they make at some senior-level meeting or conversely make decisions with zero direction. After a while, you start seeing a lot of headcount for certain ""high profile"" projects, with others literally begging for staff. If your project isn't one of them, it's just a miserable experience. Also, a number of the bosses are not approachable and pretty condescending. It is challenging to grow professionally in such an environment. In short, not a good place for anyone's career.

Cons: All departments are driven by self proclaimed incentive to proof their existence, which included HR acting like big brothers. It went as far as HR flagging if WFH is booked more than once a month, the line manager will receive email demanding reason of letting his employee to WFH. Asian authoritarian culture is getting more established and it will only get worst. The red line is being tightened as the rules cascaded downward on the hierarchy. If you have forgotten your badge, you are not allowed to be in the build. You will be likely asked by your line manager to travel all the way back home to get your badge to clock in for the day. Even if you have to take a cab to do so if you rely on company bus service. Very poor roles and responsibilities definition.

8174,8174,Dyson,6/6/2022,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,1.0,"Pros: Free 4 or 5 options for lunch on constant rotation. Free hot drinks.. Cons: LACK OF FLEXIBILITY: Zero tolerance for WFH despite it not adversely impacting many roles. Yes there is a flexible working policy. No it wasn't communicated. The few allowances for WFH days are often not accepted by the WFH HR police. The real policy is worked out through trial & error, and warnings for breaking policy limits which are not communicated. Very cloak and dagger approach. Dentist appointment? - You're expected to take holiday. No fuel at the pumps? - You'll be given a warning for ""abusing the flexible working policy"". Sick but well enough to slog through for the company working from home? - Unacceptable reason to WFH. 100% unwillingness to negotiate with staff on this. Zero trust or respect for staff. COMMUNICATION: No company goals or objectives flowed down. Policies lack clarity and do not say what they mean, if even communicated at all. Complete lack of integrity, honesty and transparency. CEO LEADERSHIP: Rare communication. Communications are boarderline rude and ungrateful, resounding more of a beating drum. ORGANISATION STRUCTURE: No logic or structure to aid you in finding anybody or information. Even being in the old boys club won't help you - partly due to the level of growth, but also due to the level of staff turnover, in itself creating a moving goalpost, making even the simplest tasks long winded and unecessarily complicated. ACCESIBILITY OF INFORMATION: Mulitple systems and databases. None communicating with the others. Convaluted and complicated. OWNER, CEO & HR: Archaic attitudes. Blatant refusal to listen to staff or recognise the widespread demoralising and disengaging environment which their attitude and actions have created. Just plain ignorant and short sighted. Example: Its the beginning of Dec 2021. People are tired. Need a break. Infections are rising quickly. Lockdown seems imminent. PM communicates the need to WFH where possible. Many remember Xmas of 2020 and the last minute lockdown. Dysons communication: You must still come in to the office.

Cons: James Dyson's mandated working from the office five days a week is backward and it is clear he holds this view because he does not trust his UK workforce. He still thinks the world should work in the same way as when he was growing Dyson in the 90s and 00s The lack of flexible working is now not applied consistently across the business as software engineers can work from a couple of days a week. The leadership within the ExCo are terrible at empathetic communication. They are caught in limbo as don't run the business beyond sales, systems and ops.

8202,8202,Dyson,10/5/2022,Highly unstructured and poorly operated organisation,1.0,"Pros: Decent pay compensation for an individual straight out of university. You get to use most of the amazing Dyson products first hand. The yearly employee discount (can be claimed thrice every year) and Amazon gift vouchers during major Indian festivals is a bonus. You will most definitely understand HOW TO NOT run an organisation or work with your team as a team-lead. If you are smart enough and have good sales acumen, you can hit sales quotas with not much effort and earn your incentives - this can be done by studying patterns and finding loopholes in the organization's practices and processes (It worked out well for me). Decent brand and image value on the resume.. Cons: TL;DR - This is NOT a great place to work. Toxic. Unprofessional. Mismanaged. The cons are definitely more than the pros. Please read all points mentioned. This being my first professional stint, I cannot compare it with any other organization, but from a general employee standpoint - there is no organisation with with such vast global presence and brand value so POORLY MISMANAGED. There is absolutely NO CLEAR COMMUNICATION between cross-functional teams which causes vital information to fall between the cracks. General operations, teams and organisational processes are SILOED leading to POOR EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE. Being a part of the sales team, there is NOT an iota of MOTIVATION or sales coaching/mentoring that is carried out to keep us productive. We worked as mere 'slaves', if I may say so. To earn incentives are the sole motivation used by managers. THERE IS NO GROWTH as there is definitely no space in the hierarchy unless the Leadership Team attempts to make room and let budding professionals grow to become leaders too. Managers adopt EXTREME MICRO-MANAGERIAL methodologies which causes extremely TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENTS. the majority of them have MBAs and experience from FMCG/Banking/Insurance and they run the teams like a tea stall and expect sales associates to sell Dyson products like mere biscuits. The 6-Day work week can be EXTREMELY TAXING for freshers and may take a toll on one's MENTAL HEALTH if no care is taken. Working on weekend's is fine to an extent. Monday's were the weekly off period. What's worse is getting calls/emails/messages and managers expecting us to reply and make sales if possible during this one cool-off period we are entitled. Most definitely UNPRODUCTIVE. Recognition and performance is lauded to the absolute minimum level possible and not something to write home about. Monthly quotas/targets are excessive and NOT REALISTIC. The incentives/bonus is NOT GREAT, very MEAGRE when compared to revenue generated as a sales function and the effort we put in. They definitely do need to work on rewarding better. Supply chain function is TERRIBLE, it hinders sales activities and orders in the pipeline. Moreover, most of the products at a given point in time are out of stock and not saleable due to supply not meeting demand. The overall work profile is monotonous and nothing new even in sales methodologies, there is not much involvement with the senior mangers/'so called mentors'. Exiting/Resigning from Dyson and concluding my professional services is by far the WORST EXPERIENCE one can go through. They are headstrong on completing the 60-90 days (60 in my case) of notice period. There is NO CONCEPT of buyout for early exit. They make it a point to keep the notice period as long as possible. Compensation as salary, incentives or other pending bonuses/settlements were NOT PAID on a timely basis during/within the period. The 60-Day notice period seems to only apply to the employee and not the employer.

Dyson’s toxic, ultra corporate work environment managed to suck most of my self esteem and confidence in my own abilities despite having several years of experience compared to many of my colleagues in similar roles. There is a culture of promoting people who know how to talk the Dyson talk and be seen by the right people, which is true of most workplaces, but even more so at Dyson. Not that I even wanted a promotion for myself - I just wanted to get the hell outta there after the first 6 months!! But really the worst was the treatment of staff during and coming out of the pandemic restrictions. It’s been widely covered here already but it was truly immoral. I felt sorry for the senior management being made to tow the line in enforcing the draconian anti-WFH rules that were surely the work of no one other than James Dyson himself. Enforcing 5 days in the office while covid was still running riot in the general population put all Dyson people and our families at risk.

However it feels as though the company is (finally) turning a corner. The new Chief people officer has made decent strides since joining and employee perks have a genuine positive impact on my life (gym, free lunches mean less prep outside of work and the food is brilliant especially the salad bar, hair dressers, sports massage etc all save me time).

8240,8240,Dyson,6/3/2022,Worst place I've ever worked!,1.0,"Pros: Benefits, but it's the same benefits you can get at other companies.. Cons: Where do I start with Dyson? It's a very toxic environment to work in. My line manager used micro managing as a tool to manage me. If you do the slightest thing wrong, whether your fault or not, then colleagues inform your line manager so you get reprimanded for it. While I was working there I did experience a low level of bullying. There is a massive lack of trust from management so they do not allow any flexible working or hybrid working. The company acted extremely poorly during covid, we had to come into the office during the lockdown because they were worried about their information being stolen, but were happy to put us at risk. This was also over Christmas, where loads of people in the office were getting sick with covid, we still had to come in 5x a week and risk getting sick ourselves and potentially ruining our Christmas. A friend of mine tested positive for covid so I tired to leave the office to get a PCR test and work from home for the rest of the day, but my line manager told me not to get a PCR test but to stay in the office and do a lateral flow. The following day I had symptoms of covid and tested positive. The company could have suggested we work from home the 2 weeks leading up to Christmas to ensure we were safe and to ensure we could visit vulnerable family members of Christmas. But they only care about their products and not their employees. The whole time I worked at Dyson we were required to wear masks all day while sitting at our desks (8.30-4.30). If you were seen without your mask on then they have 'mask police', who would go around asking you to put your mask back on and they would take a note of your name. Work starts at 8am, or 8.30 until 4.30 with the only break allowed being a 30min lunch. If you raised any concerns or complained about the bad working conditions then you were shut down and told that this was the 'dyson way' and if you didn't like it then you should leave.

No flexible working arrangements, you'd have to have your house on fire to be allowed to stay there and work whilst they put out the flames. Senior staff will tread on you for the advancement of their own careers, will steal your ideas and pass them off as their own then go and take the credit for them when they present them to the Director.

This is a policy that is out of step with the direction of most companies, and does put us at a disadvantage when recruiting for office based roles when competing with more enlightened companies. But, the implementation of this is a beautiful example of why employees, junior or senior, have fallen out of love with the company quite so spectacularly. It illustrates everything that is wrong with the current culture. So, as I see it, this is what happened. The new CPO and her team do loads of work gathering evidence of the benefits of flexible working during spring and early summer. This is vetoed by James Dyson as he has dogmatic views on flexible working that will not change. The executive have to come up with a coherent vision as to why we are flying in the face of society and come up with the concept of “campus” and just repeat that we are a campus organisation if challenged. On the plus side they come up with stuff to take the edge off- the free coffee, lunch etc. They present a policy on flexibility to suggest it is possible- you just have to go though a formal process to agree it. If permanent, an approval process where you present your reasons, if ad hoc manager approval. The permanent requests are exposed to be a way of avoiding people making formal flexible working requests (governed by a legal framework) when the majority of these requests are rejected. We are told that this process will start in September, to be logged in workday, dressed up in H&S- it’s good to know where you are in event of a fire- grounds. This is suddenly bought forward to August, with managers and HR having to go though attendance lists in the past to justify where people were in July (before “campus” attendance was mandatory). Workday goes live in September with some unexpected twists. Firstly, as part of the flexible working menus, you have to put in what category it is ie. domestic admin, medical reasons etc. There is also a comments section. We are then told to ensure that the comments section is filled in for tighter monitoring. Every week we get contacted by HR asking for more details. Also asked for reports. Now we get threatening emails for when we are managers have approved “too much” ad hoc flexibility threatening disciplinary action for both manager and employee. This is a perfect example of the duplicity of implementation- a lack of honesty and transparency.",Senior Manager,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9915,0.26630094,positive,positive

Use a job offer as leverage for your current employer, but don’t accept it",1.0,"Pros: - Nice office - if you enjoy aeroplanes, then you’ll love the assortment on site (James likes aeroplanes, apparently) - Plenty of parking on site(now near to 1000 people have been removed from the UK business) - Free lunch (although the quality and portion size has decreased) - Free coffee (just don’t expect something like you’d get at Starbucks) - Free fruit (my advice would be to stock up and feed your family as there’s no quota) - Friendly cafe staff - Physio, GP, hairdresser, amazon lockers, etc on site. Lifestyle assistance and care back up services available (probably designed to prevent pretty much anything you might present as an excuse to need to work from home) - Desks are nice and tidy (Roland likes to fly from Singapore to inspect the site to make sure we’re adhering to his tidy desk policy - apparently, James and Roland don’t like messy desks). Cons: - Daily reporting on how many people have swiped into site. This data then compared with who isn’t on holiday and e-mails from CLO sent to employees threatening disciplinary action - James and Roland personally review the data of the reasons people have submitted for working from home - Line managers were sent an e-mail stating disciplinary action would be taken if we didn’t stop our teams taking too many working from home days. A number of managers threw in the towel this week - CPO has shown some stunning examples of shutting people down on ‘listening sessions’ and actively stated that she does not want anonymous feedback…….and then wonders why no one asks a question. - Employee survey stopped as Roland doesn’t like anonymous feedback (nothing to do with the consistent nose dive in scores since his time as CEO)",Head of Department,,reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9914,0.249579125,positive,positive

Cons: What has happened since I started working with this company? When I started, the culture was all about doing the right thing, autonomy, trust and always pushing to innovate and try something new. Experiment. Then Roland became CEO. Oh my god. I’m not going to go on about the ludicrous inability to work flexibly, the simple fact is that JD has employed a “yes man” and he in turn has employed an Exec Board of “yes people”. In turn, some managers have become “yes people”. If you work for one of those (as I do) then you can genuinely expect to cry or break down. I’m on anti depressants. My manager hasn’t ever said “well done” or “thank you”. Ever. This despite the fact that I probably work longer hours than anyone else in my team, and have a proven track record. Nothing is ever good enough. And don’t - ever - make a decision which you think will be for the benefit of the company, because one day (in my case 4 years down the line) you will be chastised by not only JD and Roland but your manager and also theirs. Everyone is just too scared to back their man. Real shame. People are leaving the business in droves. The threat to the company isn’t the competition innovating quicker than us, it’s the business driving out every last piece of talent in an attempt to please JD.

There is no listening or team work, decisions are made by JD & the CEO and no one else is welcome to have any input. - Peoples health and wellbeing are not a priority as shown by the Exec team forcing employees back into the office in May 2020 during a global pandemic against all government advice and guidelines. This only stopped when the government changed the law and they realised they could be in trouble. They now claim to be against doing this, yet we are tracked by team registers and door sign ins and called if we are not on site for x days per week. This increases whenever JD is in the UK. - They claim to offer flexible working when you interview however in reality this means you can start at either 8 or 9am. Working from home is not an option and if ever you are able to, you will be monitored and micromanaged heavily. - Progression and promotions are very hit and miss. In some teams it is handled well, in the majority, progression is based on time served not output and every senior job is awarded to friends of the hiring manager and rarely even opened up for applications. - Redundancies are frequent and becoming more and more brutal, realistically no one is surprised at redundancies anymore and a lot still speculate when we will eventually be moved to Singapore.",Commercial Manager,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.8584,0.177380952,positive,positive

Mass redundancies under cover of Covid, on projects that were already behind and under resources. Changes to the performance management structure weeks before year end insisting that 10% of staff MUST be ""under performing"" regardless of their through year feedback and achievement against goals. Nonsensical restructures (or threatened ones that never materialise). Blindly insisting it is safe for everyone to be on-site through the second half of 2020 because we have masks so are 'safe'. Concerns/queries on this go unanswered HQ moved to supposedly support the car project, even though we now know that was already in the process of being wrapped up.

8684,8684,Dyson,23/12/2020,An absolute shambles.,1.0,"Pros: Getting made redundant and the subsequent compensation package.. Cons: I honestly don't know where to start... It's quite simply the worst place I have ever had the misfortune to work. I am genuinely over the moon to no longer work here. The fact they paid me to leave (along with 900 others “because of Covid-19”) has been an absolute blessing. From the very first day you realise that the place is nothing more than a shambles. No organisation, headless chickens everywhere, communication (especially across teams/departments) is non-existent. You will essentially be firefighting from day one until the day you leave. Dyson like to point out that ""it isn't for everyone"" and it's ""fast-paced"" and ""unconventional""... It's none of these things. It's merely marketing spiel to cover up for the sheer incompetence that awaits you. And that's what Dyson does best - It’s very good at marketing itself and blinds you with smoke and mirrors. Everything looks amazing from the outside, but its a very different story when you're on the inside. You will get the opportunity to work with some of the worst managers you’re ever likely to encounter. Not just in a professional capacity - there are some truly awful human beings here. There are people “running” departments/functions that are genuinely in way over their heads and the desperation is embarrassing. The company structure is incredibly top-heavy; there’s Seniors-for-this, Heads-of-that, Leads, Directors, Managers… The list goes on. Ultimately none of them are in charge or have any authority. There’s just a constant power struggle with a ‘he said, she said’ mentality, all whilst trying to get one over on each other. Because of this, collaboration is pretty much non-existent, teams always say there’s “no time” to help and trust has generally eroded to nothing. It genuinely feels like a group of separate companies competing against one another to get the upper hand. You will have to constantly revisit work that’s been “signed-off” because someone has crawled out of the woodwork at the eleventh hour and raised objections. It’s just another case of someone trying to justify their ridiculous role and subsequent exorbitant salary. That or the fact you’ve been briefed by yet another person thinking they know what they’re doing… Either way you will be forever frustrated. Oh, and don’t bother going to HR if you do have any issues - you will be seen as the problem. You will not meet a more inept group of HR “professionals”. I swear that department only exists because it's a legal business requirement. Like many functions in the company it merely pays lip-service to its roles and responsibilities. I’m not even going to get started on “Being Dyson” and the “Different, Authentic, Better” nonsense... That being said, there are some genuinely cracking people that work here (although it’s looking like a lot of them want out following this year). Unfortunately though, they are outnumbered by ‘yes-men’ and useless people that are hired by equally useless individuals (very much like a virus spreading, which is kind of ironic all things considered). In the end, I can liken the place to Springfield Nuclear Plant - If you’re a Smithers or Homer (who’s in charge of a department don’t forget) you’ll do absolutely fine here. All the while Mr. Burns just keeps on raking it in whilst the place burns. It really is a sad joke.

Broadly speaking, people care about making and delivering the best, whether it is product or improvements to the business, despite really challenging working conditions which have been mostly self inflicted by James and the CEO. I have always thought that Dyson has so much promise and could be a truly incredible place to work, sadly in my time here that promise has been slipping further and further away from becoming a reality. Years ago when people said to me ""oh Dyson, don't they just make Hoovers?"" I used to challenge them and say how we made really amazing products and technology. I don't correct them any more.. Cons: Dyson does not care about its employees. The way it has treated people has gone from badly over the last few years to immoral in the last year. Lack of diversity of background or gender, little diversity of thought or opinion which diminishes to none at the top. Toxic 'yes men' culture among senior management leading to deteriorating running of the business and ultimately poorer products at the end of the day. There is every chance that you could be a high performer, working hard for years and turn up to work tomorrow to be told you're being severed with no notice so that your work can be piled onto the rest of the team to save a pittance in cost. Internal communication within the business is appalling, falsehoods and censorship are rife, the company claims to want to be 'authentic' but employees are desperate for truth. Churning out more and more plastic products, faster and with less development and testing to make even more profit is not a compelling purpose to motivate anyone.

Cons: - Absolutely zero work-life balance: Dyson is a worldwide firm with no respect for the fact that different countries are in different timezones.

Quite normal for staff to get up at 6 am and do a few hrs work from home before their commute, then work from 8 am to 6 pm and then once home and dinner/children sorted log on for a few more hrs. It's the only way you can keep up with the international way of working. - Expenses are a joke: Expenses go unquestioned. People taking their friends out for dinner, cabs taken when people were blatantly on holiday, holidays are booked around business trips, IE book a couple of meetings in Chicago so I can fly out Business Class then take my holiday whilst I'm there. Ignorant of Gov Guidance during Covid: Insistent that desks were filled. Desks were arranged in a socially distanced fashion but that meant that it was expected that all of those desks were filled. - Raise a ticket: It is outsourced and EVERYTHING requires you to log onto an IT portal and raise a ticket to raise a job number and go in a queue to be answered by somebody in a few days. Calls are often closed unanswered - no sense of urgency. - Sloping shoulders: Too many fancy titles for rather junior roles - almost everybody is a Director of something or another meaning people are constantly delegating things around in circles. - Back-to-back meetings: Your working day is filled back to back with meetings meaning any actions that need delivering as a result of those meeting almost certainly need to be done in your own time.",Senior Executive Assistant,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9102,0.137773488,positive,positive

Yes, they are fantastic at their jobs and help the company grow, but are not fit to be a people manager (during yearly 360 performance reviews, you aren't allowed to do a review on your manager, but only other people on the team that you work with). Management will care very little about your future at the company, unless you are a favorite (many managers have a lot of favoritism in the office- favoritism is based on your personality, not performance whatsoever). - Dyson oftentimes hires externally for high positions and rarely promotes from within, so if you are looking to grow with a company and learn from management/mentors, Dyson is not the best choice. - Formal project management processes don't exist, and management will do very little to formalize a real process. This leaves employees feeling overworked because of inefficiencies in the project management process. - Beware of false promises from HR in terms of salary increases, benefits, promotions, or even an international opportunity.

I've basically been told to stay in my own lane after voicing my concerns; and this was within 2 months of me completing training. At this point, I have no desire to want to better the company or team as when I bring something up to the supervisors, they become disgruntled. In addition to this, our source of information is never updated. There is varying information/instructions going around constantly and neither the team leader's nor the sups seem to come up with the same answer; so most of the time, processes are done incorrectly by the agents.

8929,8929,Dyson,6/2/2020,So lets tell the truth here...,1.0,"Pros: Constantly seeing YOUNG and NEW bright, ambitious, happy faces... because of all the turn-over.. Cons: Dyson decided to outsource most of its core technology and financial processes to Accenture India with open eyes to “COST SAVINGS” and we are now 2 years in and guess what... it very well seems as if it has ended up costing way more to outsource, so they keep ""cutting budgets"" and ""looking for cost savings elsewhere"", and hiring 20-something year old’s who don’t know any better. An easy fix to the 50% turn-over? Our Global CIO has left the organization. Coincidence? I think not. He saw the fast-moving train to destruction. Our Vice President of Human Resources? Well she left too. Our Vice President of IT? Well she left too. Our Vice President of Legal? Oh, he found a new job. Countless Directors and people with 7+ years vested? Oh, they are gone. Again, Coincidence? I think not. I’m certain they were all privy to seeing the train to destruction. My point here is that many key people have left the organization on their own over the last year and it’s a completely different culture. Everyone is frustrated, burnt-out, or spending endless hours venting to their co-worker about how much they hate their job. Dyson will never admit the idea of outsourcing was a horrible one. Fake it till you make it, create more “redundancies” or “restructure” again when it all comes crashing to the ground? Outsourcing to India is not bad, it is ABHORRENT. Every time I get an India IT person assigned to help me with issues, I know it is doomed. They just suggest “fix” solutions instead of getting to the root of the issue. They keep dragging and delaying the issue hoping it will go away on its own. With the operations team, it’s worse. They will never voice out any problems until the magnitude becomes so huge that they can no longer sweep things under the carpet; then they expect YOU to solve it for them since they have no freaking idea what to do about it. Sloth, refusal to take ownership of problems, incapacity to think etc., the attitude problems are abundant. Hiring cheap labor workers to fill the gap of the so called “labor shortage”. This was an epic decision and the wrong one. “COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS” Allow me to destroy that statement. At face-value, the costs turn out much less. That fact is completely negated when it you realize how much time it takes Accenture to get ANYTHING done. Days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months. I had a team of 6 take 2 months to fix a simple error. I use “fix” lightly, because the issue was not solved it was disposed of. The time difference with the United States is the worst possible. They are disorganized and extremely difficult to motivate. “Yes” can have a different meaning. What once took 5 minutes now takes 5 days. They have a difficult time taking responsibility. They are very good at “excuses”. Accenture Excuse Example: My associate told me once on “Monday” that he will be sick on Friday. I asked: “Are you getting sick right now [on Monday]?” He said: “No.” I asked: “how do you know then you will get sick on Friday?” No response and then he said: “I have to go to a party on Friday.” I said, you just lost your trust in 30 seconds which you built in 6 months working with me. I asked him: “why did you lie to me?” He said: “this is the way things work in India with Indian managers.” When productivity is very low, making excuses for missing issues have very little effect or even no effect on the already low output. They make once happy people miserable. Time to be realistic Dyson. Reality always wins, and any argument made will not change that reality. Also, it is wise to keep jobs in your own country if you want to have future economic growth and a good work culture environment. What these white collared Execs in the land of Malmesbury fail to realize is how much extra work it is for us to try to coordinate efforts with people that do not have industry experience. We end up having to coach these offshore “managers” along and re-coach them and re-coach them (insert broken record). Most days, you end up feeling like a teacher with an incompetent student who will not listen or simply cannot comprehend the needs of the business. Do I think anything I wrote here will change the likely outcome of this company riding along on this train-wreck of an idea until it derails? No sir or madam. At the end of the day, Indian outsourcing is a 200-billion-dollar industry.

Cons: The constant turn over of leadership and never following through on making things better. Pretending they are addressing employee concerns but never do Saying they value employee growth and career development but not actually doing anything about it and just letting people spin their wheels forever The new processes and systems that were introduced to make things easier on us have made things worse. Especially Accenture. There is no support. Accenture is the most worthless resource and one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever seen at a company. Accenture Procurement and especially IT are terrible. Leadership pretends to care about these problems and asks for your feedback, but when you try to bring up the issues and work on solving them, they actually dont do anything about it and tell you that you are not being a team player. Very hypocritical. Most people in the office are getting more and more miserable by the day and starting to take it out on each other so what was once a friendly work environment no longer is. Claim to promote work life balance but the people who never stop working are the ones who are rewarded and revered. We are controlled and micromanaged by UK office and execs. The UK execs consist entirely of old white men who could not care less about employee satisfaction and are introducing these new systems under the guise of improving processes when all it does is improve their bottom line. Then even with all of these cost cutting measures and constant spouting of “record-breaking” profits, we somehow never manage to make full bonus. They set the goals to impossible standards so that we can never get a full bonus. We moved into a brand new office space so that we would have more room but they chose a location that gave us no room to grow and after only being there a year we are already out of space and people don’t have desks.

8956,8956,Dyson,27/10/2019,A technology company as great as their products!,5.0,"Pros: Dyson is such a great company! If you’re expecting to walk in the door of a very structured, corporate company, you are wrong. The dress code is smart casual and the company functions like any tech start-up. It is still a privately held company. It feels like a small company. There are not a lot of set processes. You don’t need to wait months to get a boards approval or sign off. The office is an agile, open floor plan. No one, regardless of title, has their own private, closed door office. Overall, the Chicago office is fairly small, about 300. I’ve had the opportunity to work with many teams not only in the US, but also Canada, Mexico, and even the UK. You really have the ability to see your work have a meaningful, global impact. I’ve also have had the opportunity to work on many side projects of things that interest me. If you raise your hand to volunteer on a project, most likely they will let you get involved in some way. The teams are also very collaborative and supportive. They truly live by the company mantra of “solve the problems others ignore”. If you’re stuck on something teammates and management are always willing to jump in to help. A team that works together succeeds together. Benefits package is good. There is a good work/ life balance. The products are truly amazing. I don’t know how I ever lived without an Air Purifier (it’s done wonders for my seasonal allergies) or an Airwrap (15 minutes to style and dry my hair, instead of 1.5 hours). Employee discount and employee special sales are always a nice perk. When a new product is released, communications does a really great job planning activities for the office and there will usually be a contest for a free product. Employees also have the opportunity to participate in new product trials. The company Christmas party is always so much fun too. It is a huge costume party. They determine a theme globally each year and there are prizes for the best dressed team.. Cons: This is not a con for me, but it can be for some. Dyson can be very ambiguous and fast paced. Dyson is still a fairly young company, especially in the Americas. Dyson has only been in Mexico since about 2016. There are not a lot of processes in place. Sometimes the information you need may not be available. No 2 days are the same. Things are constantly changing. If something is not working, we’re not going to continue to try doing things the same way. We will regroup and find a better way of doing things.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9987,0.224330608,positive,positive

Poor work/life balance in some areas with stretching (read unrealistic) objectives and timescales which mean working late into the evening several times a week. Stress levels high in some areas.

Unrealistic expectations - given only 50% of the tools needed to do your job and you are expected to ‘find it out yourself’. This mentality only works to a point!

I’ve heard employees being in the same position for years without moving up in the ladder; apparently if you’re not in the UK office, in sales, or part of the business to business teams, you will not be getting promoted. The company expects you to learn their new systems, but will not expect you to grow in your position. Also have been witness and victim to in office bullying; apparently some people will manage you based on their tenure and title. Leaders in UK have promised to change and try to improve office culture and environment, but their words are hallow and only filled with smoke and mirrors.

Dyson looks great on your resume' it will open doors, get a 3 month contract and leave so you at least have their name on your resume'. My colleagues really lovely and I made a few lifelong friends there. The hours and work life balance have improved in the time I worked there with opportunities for paid overtime.. Cons: An extremely poorly run customer care centre. Team leaders are encouraged to belittle their staff, give negative feedback and treat them like kindergarten children. Do not expect praise or thanks for work done just negative feedback on what you have not done. Never will you get any real support or help, but the lip service is really great. Work for Dyson if you love being told what you are doing wrong all the time and get no credit for the work you do. They will work you into the ground and still tell you that you did not perform. Dyson has a no bullying policy but I have documented proof that they do bully and they do it in an insidious and very damaging way. The Customer Care Management is poorly organised, reactive and with extremely poor and antiquated management skills. There is a creepy way of making out they have the knowledge and skills to run the Customer Care. Management is great at talking but not walking the talk. Beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing personalities particularly in the upper management. Bullying by proxy and lying point blank to your face is common. Big egos that makes themselves and the company very ugly. In my time at Dyson I literally saw hundreds of people come and go. A revolving door that has not been resolved with new management or a new location. Dyson Customer Care have no documented procedures. Everything is done ""on the fly"". They put so called procedures in place and have no ability to follow through. Communication is about as bad as it can get. No opportunities to move forward in the business if you are skilled or proven to be able to do so. They are really good at giving these positions to the incompetent unproven staff members mostly.

Proper release management, retrospectives and recording technical debt just not on the radar for them. - I was on projects where we had to try and convince managers to use something like Jira rather than excel for project management. - Dyson are all about the branding and marketing and they are fantastic at it. This means that people aren't honest about how low-quality the work that gets done is. - It's the kind of the place that rewards people working 70 hour weeks rather than judging quality of work produced. - Don't work here if you enjoy having an impact on the business and like producing high-quality work.

Cons: A word to describe my employment at Dyson is disappointing. As an employee I did not feel like a valued member of the team nor was my career progression ever considered. Management are incredibly arrogant and see all employees as numbers not people, they are not true leaders and lack the ability to create a cohesive and engaging environment. Hard work and outstanding achievements are rarely recognised and growth and development opportunities are seldom provided. Dyson like to make out they’re a forward thinking and pioneering company who play in the same field as Google and Apple, this is far from the truth. They have an incredibly high turnover which could be the result of; • Dramatically underpaying their employees • Overworking all teams consistently • Cutting staff discounts (employees now receive the same discount as customers) • Eliminating the annual cost of living wage increase • Hiring externally and not promoting from within • Inadequately planning for the future • Constantly implementing inefficient systems and processes • Poorly located office (there is no public transport or parking available, often employees receive fines or damage to their cars while parking near the office) It is a shame I had to give Dyson a 1 star rating to leave this review, if possible I would have given them no stars.",Anonymous Employee,Sydney,reviews,subjective,negative,,,-0.8571,0.138133333,negative,positive

There has been management change recently which has only meant good things for the place. People are genuine and know how to have a good laugh. Your ideas and feedback is taken seriously and the company is always moving forward and so it keeps you on your toes. It’s products are great and the innovation is worked on by many people for a long time and so you actually believe in the product when selling it.. Cons: Not really a con but it’s a fast moving and competitive company in the industry and so if you’re not a person who likes to be challenged and or to challenge the status quo, then it might not be the place for you.

Perhaps their R&D is but that's it. It's all smoke and mirrors. If you enjoy coasting along under the noise without any purpose then you'll fit right in.. Cons: IT - What a complete mess. Blind leading the blind. I've worked in many large organisations and this was the most chaotic & dysfunctional place I've ever experienced. No purpose or direction and so many people I'm aware of didn't end up doing the job they were hired to do. I, like others, left a good job on the false premise of what the job they were hiring for only only to find out it we were essentially mislead. If you've got any words in your propective job title / description such as ""strategic"", ""design"", ""architecture"", ""analysis"" or ""planning"" then do yourslef a favour and ignore all those words. Everything it done on a knee-jerk reaction where I've never heard the term ""JFDI"" said so much. As nothing it written down, the ""I"" in JFDI (""it"") changes subjectively on a given day depending who you speak to. As mentioned, it's chaos and certain people not only thrive under that condition but benefit from it and they're in charge at the moment. Famously the current CEO said, ""I wouldn't sack my own children if they were falling behind, I'd help them grow..."" ...weeks later there were mass redundancies. Laughable (only as I wasn't affected) but just goes to show the left hand really doesn't know what the right hand is doing. So glad to be out of there now, my sincere advice (and why I'm taking the time to post this) is don't believe the hype. Look for the themes on the various reviews and you'll notice OVERWHELMINGLY the themes for the IT side of the organisation compared to say the product and R&D side. Don't confuse the two, they may as well be completely separate companies. IT is a bloated with a plethora of people with no purpose nor distinct role yet also key functions are majorily outsourced to vendors who hold significant hold to this small-minded IT organisation ran by small-minded people.",IT Design,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9623,0.149867725,positive,positive

You are definitely not wedded to a traditional career path here! - Great opportunities to live and work abroad - (on the whole) supportive management. There are a few bad ones (same with any company!), but they are becoming less and less common - I have taken maternity leave and returned to work and found the return to work well supported - New CEO is excellent. He communicates extremely well and is very approachable. Any CEO who queues in the same coffee line as the rest of us is approachable in my books! - CCO is inspiring-genuinely makes you think that we can all achieve anything and is constantly striving to take us forward- he has really transformed marketing in the last 5 years - Great technology, and it is at the heart of everything the company does - Exciting future with further expansion already underway - Beautiful campus, great work environments, cafes and site. It is an agile working environment, so you need to be comfortable with not having an assigned ""spot"" to sit in!. Cons: - If you're expecting every part of this company to be as glossy as the brand is to consumers, it's not. It's young, systems are still developing and sometimes it really has a startup feel to it sometimes. I love it, but the company is definitely adjusting to being a big company- it means there are plenty of opportunities! - This is being addressed, but it can be frustrating that there is a real divide between the people who go above and beyond and those who do the minimum. It was very refreshing that the CEO recognized this and acknowledge it almost straight away when he took the role - The company grew fast- so all focus is on the ""what"" you do, rather than the ""how"". However, that is changing and a new performance approach has just been launched - I cannot commend the company for diversity in the head office at the moment. From a gender diversity perspective, there are definitely teams that are still all male led at a leadership level. Some lack of diversity in the head office is likely to come from the area where the office is based, but I would love to see more commitment to addressing diversity - Job titles are messy and need aligning- the titles aren't always representative of the jobs people actually do which can be frustrating to navigate - Not the place for you if you can't cope with ambiguity or changing directions! - ""Official"" career development historically has focused on those in their twenties: with graduate and ""pioneer"" programs being implemented.

Yet will screw their staff for a couple of grand at the first opportunity. The way they go to market and treat their customers, so arrogant.

9229,9229,Dyson,20/3/2018,"If your role involves software engineering / data science, don't work here",1.0,"Pros: Flexible working They pay over the odds for the low skill tasks you end up doing. I think that if you are an engineer (non-software), this can be a good place to work, but Dyson is abysmal at anything software related.. Cons: IT is terrible - it took them 5 months to provide me with a server for a large data science project. And then they tried to take it away 3 weeks later. You also don't have admin access on your laptop, so if you need to install something like python, you'll have to wait weeks. Dyson is very much a windows-based company. If you want to use UNIX you really have to push and there will be little if any support. As far as I can tell, managers do not take their role seriously. My manager only did task management, no feedback or identification of training opportunities. I did not even receive probationary period feedback (just ""it's a pass""). There are no HR processes in place to ensure that managers take their role seriously, and there is very little recourse if your manager was not behaving appropriately (Mine was dismissive, constantly talked over me and ignored my opinions. I spoke to HR repeatedly over a period of 6 months, and they did nothing. My manager and HR's reactions were the main reason I chose to leave.) Dyson is the kind of place where, if you have a good manager it can be a great place to work, but if you don't then you're completely stuck and powerless. If you work in research (RDD), you will be working in a cold double-height warehouse building. With building work going on. I started coming to work wearing thermal layers to take the edge off. Parking is absolutely terrible - get here after 8 and you likely won't find a space. Dyson has such a competitive and blame culture.

9310,9310,Dyson,1/7/2017,Dysons Taren Point call centre in Australia,1.0,"Pros: Good staff discounts are available.. Cons: During recruitment, Dyson was promoted to me as a multi-national, multi-billion dollar company seeking to transition into a global tech company. When you think of large multi billion dollar organisations in Australia, you think of companies like Apple, Facebook, Telstra, Commonwealth Bank. All these companies are on the cutting edge of various technologies. Dyson is not like any of these companies, firstly the facilities are poor and dated, something that you would expect out of the 90's. The contact center is a small office attached onto a warehouse where repairs are carried out. They are not a tech company, until very recently, they used a rostering system designed in an excel spreadsheet. During the first week, we were told that Dyson only hires the best and expects outstanding performance from all its employees, and here going above and beyond is the standard. Unfortunately, the pay is not in line with these expectations and they will pay you as close to the award wage as possible. Dyson claims to make superior products to their competitors, and they expect a premium price for the products. This philosophy definitely does not carry over to paying staff a decent wage. They offer pay far behind their multi-billion dollar competitors in Australia. If you have worked in a call centre before, you may be used to having weekly or monthly team meetings to learn about what is happening in the business, and get to know your team-mates and spend time with your team leader. This does not happen at Dyson, there are no meetings. Updates are communicated via email, you are expected to stay up to date on all emails, even though you are never provided any time to read your emails. There is a maximum 5 second gap between calls, and there will be at least 20 people waiting on hold all day, so there will never be a break. If you do not stay up to date on your emails you will be berated and criticised for it. Other people do it, so why can't you? The only way to read your emails and stay up to date is to cut corners and do things like place customers on hold, and then read your email. Management seem oblivious to admitting this, and so the cycle continues. You don't receive much opportunity to review and improve your work as a customer service representative, your Manager will send you call feedback via an excel spreadsheet with some ratings for your call, and an attached copy of the recording they rated. You are not provided any time to listen to the call, and the expectation is that you will do this in your breaks or forward it to your home to review later. The contact centre is desperately understaffed, yet also over budget and cannot increase the maximum headcount, this is despite the above 20% profit Dyson made last year which resulted in a wind fall of hundreds of millions of dollars, which the CEO wrote to the entire company to boast about. Morale is getting worse for staff, as management is clamping down on spending money to appease angry customers with broken parts, as every maximum dollar must be extracted from Dyson customers and retained, yet they can't find money to answer phone calls in a timely manner. Things got so dire before I left that in the last ""quarterly meeting"", a survey was sent around requesting for volunteers to hold the meeting during their lunch breaks, instead of the company needing to provide time to update its employees about the business. Staff who refused were berated by management and told how disappointing it was. Dyson has decided to begin to focus on internal sales, and are implementing sales KPIs into the call centre, as of the time of this review, you must sell 2 finished good products per day. Dyson does not pay any dollar based incentive scheme for these sales. I personally, have not heard of a company that did not offer an incentive scheme to people with sales-based KPIs. Dyson, in Australia at least, appears to be a company focussed on extracting as many dollars as possible from customers, whilst spending the bare, absolute minimum. As a call centre, it is a horrible, depressing work environment and I would advise anyone to avoid it, unless absolutely desperate.

Cons: This list is based on my experiences and conversations I had with colleagues. - the company is a mess, it seems they base their business decisions on a mixture of luck and ego. - or at least that's what you see because of the unbelievable lack of transparency: no strategy or direction is cascaded down the line. - C-level briefings are uninspired and non-inclusive: working for the company you'll only know as much as anybody reading the news. - diversity is not an aspect: higher management consists of middle-aged white men. No women or PoC as far as you can see. - promotions handed out based on time spent at company not on merit. This is seriously off-putting: how do you expect the good ones to stay if you don't appreciate performance. Oh and it's not an exception that bafflingly incompetent people get ahead. - no performance appraisal: it's really not worth to go above and beyond with your work, because no one will appreciate it; not your manager, not HR. It's simply not part of the culture to cherish exceptional performance. - ridiculous top-secret attitude leads to functional and knowledge silos not sharing which again causes disconnect between functional teams: duplicating efforts, and re-inventing the wheel. - no career development opportunities. No incentive from management or HR to help you grow. - do not in any case ask for help from HR or management: they'll scrutinize you and your request is only seen as a complaint. - and you cannot help your former colleagues moving on as you are prohibited from giving reference on performance. - the underdog culture should not mean that everyone has to carve out their way themselves - this is a ridiculous way to take no responsibility for employees careers. Top-down approach can and should be a part of a healthy company culture. - Management should be a role model in showing inclusiveness and integrity. Instead they lock themselves away in their ivory towers. You'll never see upper management mingling with the employees, having lunch or even a conversation with them. - middle-management is a joke: they are only preoccupied with their own career progression; no leadership skills whatsoever. - Dyson values are empty words: working for companies in the past that took culture seriously I was baffled how most employees and most work was not aligned to the alleged company values. But if you work there do not ever confront management or HR about this or you'll burn yourself. - corporate culture is vilified to the extent that processes and measurement are regarded as unnecessary bureaucracy; it is not - the company is growing at a fast pace but there is still no structured internal communication, no transparency, no onboarding process, no feedback and appraisal process - just individual efforts by a marginal layer. - old-school hierarchy: on the ""lower""-levels you have no impact on even the way you work. Keep your good ideas for a place that listens. - HR: I know you'll be reading this - and won't do anything, because let's be honest: you don't care. There's still a lot of people applying for positions so you don't even have to put minimal effort into talent retention.

Great work-life balance, beautiful offices, nicely growing company.. Cons: In general: Dyson products were always protected against competitors by patents, so nobody in this company really knows what is a real competition on the market. This is why everybody at the company is so slow, calm, doesn't really interested in the work he is doing. I only can see obsession with technology on the marketing stuffs (or at competitors). Basically they are manufacturing the same vacuum cleaners for 25 years, no real improvements, only marketing, patents and recoloring the vacuums every year. This mentality will not work in the new categories. By points: - Extremely inefficient way of working. - No clear career path. You will have no chance as managers doesnt care about you. If you want a career, find a job at other company instead, this is the easiest way. - Low salaries. - No processes. They desperately tries to solve this, but I have a feeling that they are doing it without any experience (reason: either young employees or high level leaders without any industry experience). - Many Dyson staff thinks industry standards are the Satan. - Sometimes we are reinventing the wheel. - Very slow IT infrastructure. - Sometimes I feel, that only inexperienced engineers can be managers at Dyson. Only a few are exception. - Not clear weather we design things for James Dyson or for people. No problem with it, but cant see how it will make profit for the company or for James. - Sometimes no science behind decisions, only ego. - Desperately tries to be a technology company, but it is more like a concept design office. - Badly established management who has no real plan for the project, only ad-hoc daily to-dos. - Layout in the cafe is totally crazy, sometimes I have to stand in the queue for 15-20 minutes, only two cashiers for hundreds of employees (not a good design for a design company). - No free snacks. - Cafe opening time until 16:30, but staff close tills at 16:15.

9352,9352,Dyson,5/1/2017,Dyson as a Graduate,5.0,"Pros: Dyson has a great training programme, and although at the time I worked there, you get started on a technical (but arguably menial task) one should appreciate that this is a 'test' - and that if it is done with skills and good attitude, this is invariably noticed and progression follows soon after. As much as it is tempting to think that fresh talent should not be 'blunted by the reality' of NPD (i.e. real world engineering), a spell there really enhanced my time in NPI, and helped me anticipate the potential pitfalls of product development, while remaining creatively ambitious. Dyson is a great 'finishing school' from University, and of course has huge scope to develop within the company to go beyond this.. Cons: As with any large organization, it is hard to 'stand out' - and often this is not about just being talented alone - but rather that you have the interpersonal skills and humility to work well with others, even if the initially do not share your perspective(s). This can be frustrating for graduates, who are used to a relatively 'fast' pace of progress and a corporate can feel more political.

If any issues do arise, there are solutions for them, including free phone support, a first class customer service department, excellent warranties and technical service and even free preventive maintenance in many markets. The job we do is also a benefit to our owners for follow-up questions about their products and helping them to get the very most from all their Dyson products. While there are some administrative tasks outside of the retail locations where we work, all work is paid for at the same rate, so we are encouraged to submit our admin work, training, work related phone calls, etc. I've worked with several managers -- all very professional and supportive -- some of the best I've ever worked with.

Right off the bat I was given a large amount of responsibility managing an ad campaign. I was able to work with all parts of the business - marketing, legal, finance, logistics, sales, and graphics. Not only that, but we are a global company and I am able to work very closely with people from all around the world. Every day poses a new challenge and I get to interact with people constantly (a huge plus for me, because I don't like the idea of being chained to a desk in a cubicle). The group that works at Dyson is downright hilarious. They are also incredibly patient when it comes to helping out a new youngster in the office. And on that note, our office is amazing - a completely open floor plan (no cubicles!). As an entry level employee, I sit just a chair roll away from some of our senior management. Our management is wonderful - approachable and easy to talk to. (And they have a wonderful sense of humor! Yes this is a professional place, but that doesn't mean we don’t joke around). Do I even need to mention our products? They’re innovative, premium, and colorful! Working at Dyson is what you make of it. If you’re enthusiastic and happy, people will respond positively. You can make a great career at Dyson – the choice is yours.. Cons: As a company, Dyson has a very set way of doing things. I think as a company we need to step out of our comfort zone to move forward. As for Dyson’s employees, we should have more in-office activities and contests (happy hours, events in the café, raffles, lunches, etc.) I think Dyson is headed down the direction of obtaining that “work hard play hard” attitude that so many companies strive for, but we just need to hone into that together.

9493,9493,Dyson,2/10/2014,"Fantastic Place to Work & Highly Recommend it, But There Are a Few Issues",5.0,"Pros: Dyson is a fantastic place to work which is tailored for individuals who can roll with the punches and enjoy new challenges, which might have been outside of their initial role’s scope. The work life balance is great since it incorporates flex hours, plenty of PTO & sick days, as well as great benefits package. On top of these great benefits you also can take advantage of a very generous discount program for the new products / technology which is released. The company has also gone through a bit of a re-org which has been fantastic for Dyson and I think it addresses many of the cons provided by the other reviewers. The new members of the management team (for the most part) have degrees that support their positions, experience in other industries that can be utilized to help Dyson progress, and they are very approachable. I specifically called out “for the most part” since that is where my input on what can be improved upon comes into play. Another great “pro” for the company is that they have realized the importance of recruiting and retaining talented employees. When I was first hired there was always a priority around the engineers, but the other departmental functions were a bit of an afterthought. With the new management team however, it appears that they have realized that every department is a necessary component which drives the business forward. Dyson has started addressing its online presence by responding to reviews (positive & negative), which I am huge proponent of. When purchasing a premium product with a higher price point, it is only natural to hop on the internet and start looking into customer reviews. This same principle is especially prevalent when looking for a new position, thus the popularity of Glassdoor. If I am going to leave my current employer and take a chance with Dyson, I want to see what past and current employees experienced. If I see a slew of reviews which all touch on how horrible Dyson is without a response, it only leaves me to assume that maybe these reviewers are not just sour with the company and have legitimate criticisms. Now that Dyson is responding to the reviews, it takes away the credibility of the reviewers who spouted on about how much Dyson doesn’t care about its employees. If the company is willing to have senior members respond to reviews, I can only assume that they care about the current and future employees a great deal.. Cons: Just like anything else in life there is a Yin to the Yang, so inevitably there are things that could be worked on. The only con that I have with Dyson is that some of the middle management (below director level & certainly not the majority) really have no idea what they are doing and are downright bullies. A select number of individuals have taken the union worker’s mind-set which I perceive as, hold my position for as long as I possibly can and not train those under me in order to retain my position. These individuals are narcissistic in nature and will continue to spout how much they are needed, but in reality if you need to make a case to why you should stay you probably are not needed. I refer to this phenomenon as “Bob Syndrome,” for those of you who have ever seen Office Space. Consultant:” What exactly do you do here Bob?” Bob (screaming): “I AM GOOD AT DEALING WITH PEOPLE.” The most unfortunate part about the situation is that their teams have great ideas and want to be innovative but are too afraid to do so. The team’s ideas never come to fruition since the bad middle managers will either bury the idea so it will never see the light of day or simply yell and berate you until you just won’t make any more suggestions. By doing this these types of individuals can hide the fact that their processes and procedures that they instilled have been horribly inefficient for years form their superiors. I have personally seen things that could have been done in minutes rather than hours and simple process change (Six Sigma) what would easily save upwards of $100,000 annually. It is very easy to spot these individuals, simply ask them a few very basic questions regarding what they claim to be experts in. I will guarantee that if you ask them for a simple document or report which pertains to their discipline that they will not be able to produce it while you are there. They will then find someone who actually has the skillset (either on their team or another), have them do it, and then return to you saying that they had completed it.",Anonymous Employee,"Chicago, IL",reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9969,0.139991506,positive,positive

The company supports premier educational institutions in the UK, and also gives back to the community via James Dyson Foundation. Dyson pays his taxes. - Great perks and benefits - Great mix of people from a variety of cultural/ethnic backgrounds make for an interesting work environment. - The average engineer is about 26 years old. Their energy, ingenuity and motivation to work hard more than make up for their lack of experience. If you lack experience, there are also enough experienced engineers and managers in senior roles to learn from. - Employees take pride in their work. - Employees are quite entrepreneurial. Many have side projects and interests. - Continuous professional development is taken seriously. You will be learning all the time, and there are many whose only job is training and development of others in the company. Managers are happy to set budget aside to send people to international conferences, courses, and industrial events. - You will fly business class whatever your job title and wherever you go. - The company is located in a beautiful part of the country and commuting via little towns and villages on the way to work everyday is a pleasure. - Good, subsidised food from the on-campus Cafe, all locally sourced. - Most people car-share.

Cons: - Spend $ to get Islander membership cause it's much faster to get in than RWS8 (Only free if you board from H'Front Ctr and makes a big round to turn into RWS) - Toxic, manipulative and no EQ bosses who don't know what they want and only have negative/counterproductive feedback to the work you have done. Likes to belittle other BUs behind their backs. - Very fast-paced and merciless culture (e.g. Morning request for a proposal deck and EOD you better produce it or you'll get it real bad by the bosses) - High pressure and high stress environment - Often rush to prepare decks for nothing and end up on hold/delayed/axed cause management didn't like it or cause suddenly no budget or suddenly something else became a priority (Strategic direction changes so often until you don't seem to know what exactly is the direction) - OT a lot, poor work-life balance and worst, no respect for your work-life balance (e.g. Bosses often text you on weekdays 9/10pm to ask about things and probably you need to do it thereafter or the next day morning) - Whole organization is in a big mess (legacy issues when predecessors didn't handover properly which resulted in everyone being clueless and overall, you can feel it when you work with other BUs) - In-house systems plagued with lots of issues/problems and management don't seem willing to set aside more $ to make it better. Worse of all, there are quite a no. of systems in place and a lot of them are not interlinked to each other (Another set of problems altogether). - HR/organization doesn't advocate work-life balance and ""kampung"" spirit is non-existent - Remuneration, perks, benefits and everything else in btw is low/pathetic for the pain you have to go through - A lot of unnecessary work processes (e.g. Fill up 3 forms just to prepare a simple EDM/SMS) and a lot of it are so manual which you waste time doing things like this when you can be doing more important tasks - Arrowed to help out in things totally unrelated to your work (Clear queue + assist in customer enquires for those who wanted to convert their USS 1 day tix to Season Pass and SDA duties to ""check"" on patrons) - What you learn/experience here may not be valuable/useful/transferrable if you wanna move out to another industry",Marketing,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,,,-0.9048,0.004116162,negative,positive

But blames you when you are not able to provide results as seen in their reference to proper five star hotels. - The cafeteria food is the worst, they are literally as bad or worse than prison food. The staff food in Marina Bay Sands instead feels like you're eating in a five-star hotel buffet. It's no wonder you don't see management level people eating in the cafeteria of RWS while you often see management levels in MBS eating together with the staffs. -Benefits are atrocious for those who have had worked in better environments/ hotel groups. -All talk no action in all levels. -They suck you dry until you wanted to leave then they offer you promotion. It's something I found out later on from others that joined from outside to the same position. But they pay those that just join in higher than those being internally promoted. And normally they tried to that those of lower levels do as much as possible till the limit before they even consider any promotions. -So much more that is wrong with this organization that I'm not gonna write anymore.

Some 'favorites' are bearable or even make reasonably good bosses but you will likely be managed by or be affected by the leadership of inexperienced individuals who rose up the ranks for unexplained reasons and no signs of true capability. Extremely frequent reorgs are normal --- crucial or pivotal teams and departments get managed suddenly by someone with little management experience, capability, and domain knowledge. Nothing you can do about it as it's the emperor's orders. These comments are specific to those with work experience and seeking full-time positions and to accumulate work experience, or worse seeking a 'career' in RWS. You will be worth so much more in other organisations with a more positive and healthier culture. For casual or part-timer positions or fresh graduates, RWS will be a 'fun' and positive workplace if they are not embroiled in palace matters. You can be one who has *seen it all* or is resilient or able to survive such environment by adopting a ""what don't kill you make you stronger"" mindset or strive to be one of the favorites.

Cons: As the title suggests, whatever the company plans or does, it's for their own benefits. Senior management or long-stayers (over-stayers in human context) only execute instructions / commands to please one person. HR does not protect employees as policies are planned based on the thinking and opinions of one person. Performance Appraisal is just a paper exercise to protect the company against potential backlash from MOM (just in case some unhappy employees complain, they can use it to support the so-called poor performance). So don't expect HR to protect employees in this company. Employees do well when they choose the right camps. Being in the right camp means you can get promoted easily and whatever that you share, it becomes the most precious piece of work or advice produced (doesn't matter if it is already circulating in the human world for more than 5 years or even outdated). Innovation is simply the use of technology in the eyes of this company. Developing a mobile app is considered innovation; does not matter if the app serves no purpose of the customers. Always remember the rule #1 (see the title). Employees get transferred around regardless of skillsets and usually without training provided. Employees are merely like pawn pieces to play with based on the mood of one person or the subordinates of the one person. Change is a constant and logical thinking from outside world is not acceptable. So march is the exodus period when employees claim their bonus and leave.

More people get promoted from within than in any other place I've worked. The bonus structure and health insurance are top tier. I actually got a ""wow"" when my doctor's office looked at my insurance coverage. This place will challenge you creatively, but they are upfront about that. Overall, I've been really impressed.. Cons: Many creatives work in a PC/Windows environment, which is a first for me. There can be technical roadblocks (encryption, asset embargos, no central servers, can't save to drives, security, etc.) that really hinder the work. Vacation is a bit low (4 weeks for everyone). All the usual ad agency pain points (late nights, weekend work, some crazy deadlines). That part isn't any better or worse than other places I've worked.

There is a LOT of work to be done all the time. I've experienced a lot of team mentality when it comes to work/life balance. When someone has something personal going on, the rest of the team steps up. The pay and benefits seem very fair. There is a small matching % for 401k which is better than nothing. And so far there is an excellent bonus system based off of your performance review. I feel lucky to be on a team that looks out for one another, and hope that the rest of the company takes notice of teams that are doing it right.. Cons: The company is not in Dallas, so anyone living in the city there is quite a commute.

I would always ask what's going on, is there anything to do but he never wanted me to know about anything. He preferred I managed myself - which was fine - but then would take credit for all the work I had done as though it was him who had initiated it. I flagged this up to management on 3 occasions and nothing was done to improve things. All they cared about was ’image’ and making sure things looked good even though nothing was ever getting done.

Now, I have spent 12 years of my life in various Engg and PM roles and have seen a fair bit of office politics. But this is a whole new level.

Except these, a lot of other things are bad.. Cons: Cons: 1) The culture is last-minute culture. They do not understand that things need to be properly planned and executed. If they need something for the weekend, they will only raise last-minute on Friday evening and call you “blocker” if you don’t work on Friday night or weekends. 2) Many bad managers are around (although new managers seem to be good). Bad managers will not protect the team and they will not care about the wellness of the employees. Instead of finding out why there are so many last-minute requests (from number 1), managers will just ask the employees to work on weekends. If you do not work on weekends, they will mark you as “under-performer” and just let you go. They basically treat employees as slaves and expect to work 24/7. 3) During town hall in front of everyone, department head likes to say that they are building the best place to work and grow and weekends work are not expected. Yet after the town hall behind the scene, they will still ask employees to work on weekends. 4) Poor work-life balance 5) Performance review is very biased based on “personality favoritism” and not on actual performance. Even if your performance is decent, if you make 1 mistake, you may be asked to go. However, those people who are performing nothing will stay in the company for long. 6) They do not know how to scale or plan ahead. When engineers work on issues, they only care about fixing the issues in the short-term without thinking about long-term scalability, stability, sustainability or security. Many people in tech team call themselves as tech person but they are not even familiar with those concepts. So there are many recurring issues because things were not properly done in the first place. It may not be engineers fault because they are all over-worked because of bad managers above (from number 2). 7) Founders make mistakes and wrong decisions at the expense of employees, like closing down Australia and Bangalore office, laying off many people across all regions and giving less than 1-month bonus with 0 increment. 8) No job security. You may be let go anytime. We cannot trust the founders. After Australia and Bangalore office closed, founders mentioned in the town hall that there would be no more laying off. Soon after that town hall, laying off in Singapore started. 9) Positive reviews here are doubtful because employees are asked to write good reviews and they are asked to put themselves as “Shareholder” on LinkedIn. 10) Out of my 10 years of working experience, Circles.Life experience is the worst ever.

Perks are abundant at Circles.Life, food, snacks, drinks, coffee.. Cons: A very unforward-thinking organization. 1) Clear over-hiring practices during scaling for an asset-light company, and then performed several retrenchment/firing exercises (only join if you're looking to use them as a stepping stone). 2) Claim to be fast-paced, but sets yearly OKRs, which are not realistic due to the nature of the industry and competition, etc. Even though they tried adapting the quarterly OKR model, no clear methodology was used to deploy the new process. 3) Had more than a year to develop the ""ecosystem"" that they've always touted to investors, but chose not to. The evidence of this was the demolition of the ideathon practice where they encouraged employees to contribute new ideas for new relevant products or verticals. Key unresolved issues within the top management. A) The '3-cofounder' model is clearly a tactic to absolve themselves from mistakes and responsibility. They refuse to nominate 1 CEO. Each co-founder supposedly has a clear portfolio to manage, but in reality, they overlap, thus small issues can take months to resolve due to disagreement among themselves. If you're looking for a company with strong leadership, give this one a pass. B) They are clearly inexperienced handling a company of this size and stage. Even the CTO seems to be better equipped in handling the direction of the company. Hold on, why is there a CTO if there are no C-suites? Dishonesty is the core of this company. i) For all the talk about bonuses and stock options, they never kept their promises. Terms in the contract are intentionally made vague (it's technically legal, so there's no case to bring to court). If you've been offered a role, please question the HR hard because you can be sure they can't give specifics. ii) Their transparency is a farce as important communications to employees keep dwindling. They also don't address legitimate issues that have been raised in meetings and townhalls. The values and mission they keep selling are never seen in the 3 co-founders, so don't expect anyone else to exhibit them! iii) You'll be surprised to find out that there's no fixed date for payroll as well.

It all started with the sudden unexplained firing of pioners who helped set up the company in the first place. This followed by layoffs and overdoing things to do the damage control. Their sole objective is now to quantify profits in every aspect with zero people management skills. This quantification is so much so that they even quantified bonuses and appraisals breaking clauses in offer letters which guaranteed a minimum bonus, which is illegal and the company deserves to be sued for this. What they don't realize is this can create a hostile environment as people can start firefighting to gain promotions and appraisal by hook or crook. With people being let go, credits for work not being given if their work doesn't seem to contribute to the company's profit. A lot of people feel beaten down, cornered and uncertain about what is the next turn going to be.

Heard from my other department colleagues that they barely see their bosses unless urgent but for mine, they organise non effective meetings every morning and expect so many things to do??? Very stressful. Too many office politics as well. Colleagues may be really nice but we all know those are pretentious: just them working professionally but it's so obvious that they dislike you and ask you to do their workload despite them having a role higher than you.

The part timer pay is way too low yet we were required to do the same or more work than the full timers. Another manager didn’t let part timer choose non-closing shifts just so that they could exploit them to clean the whole freaking shop by ourselves while the full timers just slack around. And why do part timers even have sales targets when they don’t get commission? It’s ridiculous. The way the break times are scheduled (by the manager) is also really dumb. For an 11am-8pm shift, they might assign you a break at 1pm-2pm and then you just have to deal with being hungry all the way till 8pm. (6 hours) The working environment is unsafe as well. We were required to climb the shelves to retrieve stocks for customers, and the shelves were pretty unstable with some almost falling apart.

13618,13618,Mapletree Investments,18/1/2019,Only if you are looking for a job not a career,1.0,"Pros: - Office at a convenient location with amenities - It is a decent company if you only want a job. For the young ones who hold ambition and drive, it will be quite a waste of time unless you have the stars aligned.. Cons: - If you are looking to make progression in your career, you are better off taking your years to another place that values it or you can just do a 'stop-over' here just for name-sake and then move on. - The department I work in is extremely stacked up. You can be stuck in a position for years and not understand why you never move up, instead there seems to be more stacking up above you. On the average if you are a performer, unless you are extremely lucky to have your stars aligned, the fastest it will take you is 3-4years to move from 1 job grade to another (note it is job grade, not position and this is also hugely dependent if you have a manager who speaks out for you and whether your level is flooded with new hires). If you are a lady and you decide to go for maternity leave, you start from zero when you return. Unfortunately, the mass 80% of us are not considered as performers. As the top performers leave, those who are left behind are just those who have accepted that this is a job not a career. - New hires are always of a lower caliber. No opportunities given to existing staff as management thinks existing staff have stagnated (not because there is a motivation issue to address) and they need new blood. Interestingly 'new blood' do not tend to want to stay long so the same cycle keeps happening. - There is no room for progression and management does not bother about development of their staff. There is no culture of mentoring and training is not targeted to what the staff needs. They will do blanket training just to tick off the box that training has been provided. If you choose not to attend, there is no budget for anything else you will want to do. Training budget is an unrealistic figure which HR will estimate based on historical trends. You will see this budget go nowhere because it will never be reflective of development needs. - This is a company with little direction (or perhaps there is but most of us at ground level will never know).

Cons: - There is almost no room for progression internally as the management sets an unrealistic bar for existing staff to be promoted, yet a very low bar for new hires. Try looking at the job portals and you will find the endless stream of job vacancies. So please be get yourself a decent position, should you consider to join the organization, as you might be stuck there for a long while (unless you play very good politics) - There is very poor communication between management to the operational staff as the middle management will 99% of the time filter off information which the top management thought would have been disseminated. This causes alot of needless gossiping in the opaque environment. The only time you will have a staff communication is the yearly affair of telling you when you will receive your bonus. Other than that, you will be better off trying to read news of the company through the press/social media than hearing it from the management. - Processes are not catching up with the growth of the business.

Staff who commit themselves to work outside of office hours and while on leave are rewarded more than and preferred to those who do not.

It may take many reworks before the final approval is given.

13663,13663,Mapletree Investments,20/8/2015,Its All Just Business,1.0,"Pros: These are only positive things I observed during my stay: 1) Higher than average bonus payout in the market. 2) Very well equipped with work equipment/tools and welfare facilities. 3) Good benefits and compensation package.. Cons: There are even more cons weighing down the pros, so do make a careful and wise decision before joining. Just ask around your friends and get some insight of the department you will be joining. 1) Slave driver company - The high bonus payout is literally masking as a carrot to compensate one for the extremely and/or ridiculously long hours. Overtime is a norm, may not appear so to all department, but it happens in most. Some departments worked an average of 12hours per day with no lull period to look forward to. Seriously, there are firms outside paying similar bonus but with reasonable hours. Do remember that money can never buy intangible things, such as time with family and friends. 2) Expectations - Provision of relevant tools and facilities does not equate to their generosity. It is an equivalent trade of their expectation of you to perform your duties promptly. For example, they provide a laptop and you will be very much expected to read and/or reply emails after office hours and over the weekend. Of course you can ignore working over weekends, but you will realize the load of backlog when you check your emails on the next working day. 3) Culture - Its a harsh environment, more than 70 percent of the employees are just rushing to put themselves in good books of their superior, and sad to say, at the expense of their own hours or their subordinates. These rush-and-hush can lead to abortive work, and I have to remind you, these are ad-hoc assignments on top of already heavy, backlog, no-lull-period workload. If you are entering at the most junior position with no one to delegate the work to... You can give this place a pass or you will be burning long hours. 4) No empathy (at all) - Its a norm for organization wants you to voice out if you cannot manage. Yes, we will, and usually they will provide lips service saying they hear us, with nothing done later. Well, do not expect any dog-patting-consoling-message here. Cause - It is All Just Business. If you cannot take the heat and raised your hands, you are likely to be told that the high bonus is exactly why you are expected to work such long hours, plus, you will be branded/marked thereafter. To them, the door is always there, you can walk out anytime if you cannot compete in their race for billions. There will, and always be, someone who is suitable for their rat race. 5) Training/Guidance/Coaching - Slow, no, zero. Training comes very slow, you are already 3months into the job when you realize an email requesting you to sign up to go understand more about the organization structure. Well, you probably already at least 60 percent familiar with the organization and/or you may not even have time to attend training. You may be thinking your superiors and peers may already guide/coach you along. Think again, and look at what was mentioned in point no.3, no one can be bothered with you. 6) Arduous start (and also on-going) - The I.T. department is a surprisingly fast working bunch who would set up your email right after you signed the appointment letter. The earlier you sign, the earlier your email account is set, and the earlier worked are and can be assigned to you by your sick superiors and peers whom cannot wait to lighten their own workload. So imagine opening your email on your first working day and realize over 50 emails of backlog work assigned to your when you were still serving your notice in previous company. If you think the people has empathy to understand? Then you should refer to point no.4. And if you think anyone is patient to guide you? See point no.5. You are on yourself. 7) Value of work - Every company has paper work, none can entirely alleviate from it. But an enormity of your hours spent here are on plain administrative paper work. In fact, even more, than most statutory board. This boils down to the value of the work you are doing, are you doing/learning something useful? Are you gaining valuable experience from those paper work? Even if you are ok, for now, are you going to work 4-5years doing all these time and time again? Alright, lets say you really endured a good 5years. During your next job interview elsewhere, what are you going to sell about your experience and value of work you have done there? So if you are looking for a job to stay long term and gain valuable experience, you can give this place a miss. 8) High Turnover - Needless to say with the aforesaid, I was also amongst the casualties that contributed to the high turnover. It is not a matter of perseverance, it is a matter of worth. When you start weighing all aspects of your life with this job (i.e.Career progression, family work life balance, money, knowledge and experience gained etc.), you will realize that there is nothing much that the company can offer you except for money. If you are an aggressive, out-of-the-world career minded person who can deny the need for any of point no.1 to 7, then you are cut for their job/work.",Executive,Singapore,reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9944,0.118069796,positive,positive

However, most of the overseas postings can be quite tough, with little support from HQ and high (and sometimes unrealistic) expectations. 2. Pay is decent, some good performers do very well with high bonuses and promotions. You will sacrifice your work-life balance, your sleep, your health and be stressed out. 3. There should still be at least 1 - 2 IPOs left, so staff can buy shares set aside for them. (subject to quota at market rate). 4. The work itself can be interesting, and can be a good place to learn a lot if you have the right attitude AND have the right boss + colleagues. 5. General direction of the company strategy is sound, no need to worry that company will collapse or go bankrupt, just a matter of how well it does.. Cons: 1. A lot of politics in some departments. 2. Some bosses are really poor. Common complaints heard around the water cooler include small-mindedness, uncaring, (overly) demanding, and some even ""throw employees under the bus"".

Cons: Unprofessional and inexperienced management that despite having deep education sector experience, do not know how to run a business or manage people. High staff turnover, talented/competent people do not stay at Navitas, the staff who remain have very low motivation levels and are very negative about the company and management. Poor recruitment strategy: management do not put effort into recruiting suitable people for the long-term, focus is short-term ""bodies at desks"".

13887,13887,Navitas,13/11/2019,Wasn’t a nice place to work,1.0,"Pros: Most of my colleagues were great, they deserve more.. Cons: I’ve worked in finance for two and a half years and initially it was a nice place to work. However, it changed as soon as the new management came in and it fell apart rapidly! New members of staff don’t get properly trained and left in the deep end and when actually trying will get told off for doing things wrong. Which leaves you feeling like you’re not doing a good enough job. The way the staff were being treated was truly terrible, in fact on one occasion a manager actively tried to force a staff members out, outrageous! I’ve seen so many staff members spoken to with disrespect, you get spoken to like a child and not as a professional. The way in which management speak to people behind their backs is shocking and they have there favourites which has caused division in the whole of finance and ruined working relationships because of dis-trust. The staff know who are the favourites and who aren’t, if you’re aren’t then be prepared to be shunned and made to feel worthless. The staff turnover as a whole is very high, in finance alone since January this year 12 employees have left! During the summer I’ve seen four members of staff breakdown crying, four staff members go off sick due to stress and how the management have treated them including myself. No point going to HR they won’t do anything, they should be ashamed of themselves, to see how the staff have been treated and yet have done nothing about it. To rub salt in the wound they actually defend the management even if you have examples of how you’re being treated, it’s all swept under the carpet. Two managers in particular have no people skills, out right rude and are a disgrace how they treat there own staff. I’ve witnessed two members of staff crying because how they were spoken too by a particular manager. PLEASE DO NOT THINK OF WORKING HERE.

13888,13888,Navitas,25/10/2019,One word to describe this company: ABYSMAL,1.0,"Pros: There are no pros about this company. Cons: I have worked in arc admission for a long while.I’ve seen it go from decent to absolutely awful. The cause is the outrageous vile management behaviour. They are dreadful and should truly be ashamed of how they treat staff. They literally have a mentality that our staff is at the bottom of the food chain, so let’s just treat them like peasants. Underpaid and over worked. There has been so many complaints about how the pay is too low but all the management do is excuse the poor pay or say “if your not happy then just leave” disgusting response by management. I have seen certain people singled out by management. This company knows nothing about fairness and equality. When you go to higher management with a valid complaint about a line manager you will just be told that no manager is perfect but when it’s the other way round they will try to get rid of you. High staff turn over, not allowed to even speak to your colleagues without managers on your back it’s very much a prison like environment. Almost like “do your work you will only get your meal at lunch time”. Thinking of going to HR ? Think again. They are just as bad, half of the HR don’t care the other half are nasty they will take the side of the managers and look to conspire against you for even bringing up a valid complaint. HR in this company are not mediators but 100 percent on managers side they don’t try to hide it. Even when the managers are in the wrong they are absolutely vile, they verbally abuse you and tell you no one likes you and your years of service don’t mean that they owe you anything. HR you should feel disgusted within yourself, Both HR and management should be ashamed of yourselves you are not nice people let alone employers. You will get promoted if you are a brown noser or a snake. Thinking of working here? DONT turn back around and go find a nice company to work for, you deserve more than this disgusting management. I’d like to say all departments in navitas are different but I’ve even seen finance being treated in an awful way by management, again high staff turn over. Surely if you see so many people leaving with the same complaints you’d question your management skills all these people can’t just be feeling the same way if it was genuinely a nice place to work.

Good salary, good holiday allowance but this is where I start to struggle.... Cons: The company certainly talks alot about its staff in the Colleges and have put together some incentives to show they are willing but the truth is, it's all lip service. When it comes down to the nitty gritty, they don't want to know. There is no progression within the BU's and neither is there support, mentoring or nurturing. Ideas and suggestions for improvement fall on deaf ears. Over the last couple of years, several senior figures have jumped ship (or have been pushed) and this has had a significant impact on the Colleges. Morale is shockingly low as more and more pressure and work is put on lower level staff all due to a bad decision to shift to centralise shared services. This doesn't work well as the company has now lost loyal, trusted, experienced staff across the board.
