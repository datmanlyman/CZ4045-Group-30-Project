During the party, in addition to the Christmas buffet lunch there were also free ice-cream (Udders), Gongcha bubble tea, photobooth, caricature artists, henna tattoo etc. It was really fun for my colleagues and especially for my kids. They get to see where I work and I dont have to worry about childcare arrangement that day because we are allowed to go home early after the party. 

Other aspect of benefits I enjoy is that I earn time off hours when I work beyond hours. This means that if I have to work really late for a a few days or during weekend, I can take time off work the following week if schedule permits. Its as flexible as taking 1-2 hours time off to start work later or to take time off towards the end of the day (which means a shorter work day for me for that day). In other companies, as an executive you dont get hours paid back to you, so I really appreciate the work-hours flexibility as a parent.

5629,5629,ST Engineering,14/6/2021,A technology company which is lagging behind others...,1.0,"Pros: A good place for retirement. Cons: Feedback is reference to ST Engineering Electronics (now known as Digital Systems) <> Recent reorganisation made things worse with the additional middle layer, ""mostly not inspiring"". Apart from higher overhead expenses, the additional layer resulted in unnecessary reports, multiple deadlines and lower productivity. For example, an actual deadline in June will result in having 1 or 2 intermediate deadlines in May. Moreover, there are endless requests for multiple reports for the same information. The time would be better used on analysis, strategising and productivity improvement instead of churning reports. <> If not for Covid-19, digital transformation is unlikely to take place in this ""Technology"" company. Nevertheless, there is still great resistance to invest in things like docusign, adobe sign and other similar tools to reduce the amount of paperwork + transport time/logistic costs for multiple levels of approvals. Moreover, there are still managers/supervisors who ask local participants to gather in a room to carry out conference calls with overseas participants. Why do that during covid-19 pandemic (when WFH should be default) instead of allowing every participant to join conference calls directly from home? It would have been safer + more productive (saving staff transportation time and cost). <> There is a lack of learning culture in the organisation. Training opportunities are often limited to engineers, neglecting the need to train all employees to equip them with the right skills (& tools) to improve productivity. Hence, some Corporate functions are run by staff who lack basic skills such as MS Powerpoint, Excel, or Word. Examples - Some of the staff in IT are not even able to provide basic troubleshooting to assist staff. - There are managers/supervisors who are totally handicap when their staff are on vacation (or sick leave). They are not even sure how to make simple amendments to presentation slides or calendar invites. <> After years of 'Productization' talk, nothing much has changed. - Core Business still remains as: System Integration, White Labelling and Maintenance & Support. Many staff who have drive & passion to develop 'made in SIngapore' products eventually gave up and left the company Generally, there is a low sense of urgency and resistance to try new things or grow the business out of Singapore Government and Defence. Every new idea or initiative is often seen as 'more work' + 'higher risk of failure'. People tend to avoid being involved in new ideas/initiatives and carry on with their 'business as usual'. This 'lack of drive' mindset is terrible and results in low productivity and efficiency. Examples - An opportunity where overseas customer demand for 'shorter than usual timeline': Instead of trying to work towards customer's request, the team chose not to pursue the opportunity to build a track record. - Secretaries (most, not all) will ask most junior meeting participants to manage calendar invites, venue, setting up meeting rooms and arrange overseas travel. While in other companies, Secretaries not only take care of all administrative and logistic matters (calendar invites, setting up meeting venues, arranging overseas travel, etc.) but also join meetings to take minutes wherever possible. Interestingly, the canteen is always buzzling and it is strange how these people have so much time to chit-chat. Confidential discussions (among 8 or less colleagues) often ended up as an open secret. Many staff lack the maturity to keep confidential information to themselves and instead use it to boast that they know a lot. <> The frequent influx of military people into the company may not be wise. The company is not recruiting the best people from the market with the right skills for the job. It will not change the perception that the company is just a 2nd career for ex-military personnel. Moreover, it will make it difficult to change the deep-seeded culture in the company. The ""Force"" is strong with this company.

They have no compassion to employees. The hardworking personnel are tired and sweating installing components, troubleshooting and doing modification while the managers are pretending to work woth their nonsense daily meetings. The company would save tons of money by not hiring too many lazy incompetent managers but instead hire more field licensed aircraft engineers, technicians, software developers in the engineering department.

6075,6075,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,22/8/2008,"If you have a choice, don't work for Panasonic AV Networks Singapore.",1.0,"Pros: The good reason of working in Panasonic AV Networks Singapore is that the colleagues are very friendly. They are willing to share knowledge. Whatever they know or whatever result of study they find out, they will put into the database and everyone is free to access it. You definitely can learn a lot of technical stuff if you are in the R&D team.. Cons: They expect you to work for long hours with very low pay. They just pay S$9 per hour for over-time and you are expected to stay back till 9pm or 10pm. The office hours is from 8am to 5.30pm. Sometimes, you are required to come during Saturday and Sunday. It is better not to come on any weekend. Once you tell that you can come on one weekend, you will be asked to come every weekend. The working hours are not that flexible. If you are late for just even 1 second, they will deduct your salary. Every morning, every one is supposed to sing the company song. Then, depending on the group you are in, some group managers expect the employees to tell what they plan to do in a day. You can't have nothing to say. If you have nothing to say, it will give bad impression to the manager (especially software group). This will affect your review. Besides, you are not expected to say the same thing every morning. If you do that, the manager will ask you when you are going to finish you job. Every Friday, you are expected to write in a weekly report, telling what you have done in the whole week. This is kind of getting monitored all the while. The so-called ""Adviser"" of the software group keeps saying that if you have doubt on something, you can seek advice from him. When you really seek advice, he will ask what you plan to do. Ridiculous, huh? If you never hear of a software general manager who doesn't know software, you can find in this company. The software so-called GM never side to the local employees. He sides Japan very much more than anything. If Japan says one thing, he dares not confront. In the end, it is the Singapore software group to suffer. One of the colleagues' wife had internal bleeding due to pregnancy, he asked for leave. The software GM disallowed him to take leave. Is this human?? Secondly, it is the management side. They keep saying that they have no money for our increment and bonus. Yet, you can see the Japanese ""Advisers"", who are stationed here, are given a car each and a condominium each to stay with their families. When some colleagues are to stationed in Singapore for a few days, they are asked to stay in a hotel which costs less than S$100 per night. You can imagine what kind of hotel that is. When some Japanese are sent to work in Singapore for a few days, they are offered 5-star hotel in the city. Can you imagine how terrible this company is. Yet, our increment is S$10 to S$30 per year. That is less than 1% of slightly more than 1%. If you compare to the inflation rate, you will become poorer and poorer as you work for many years in this company. Yet, some Japanese advisers can play the ""rich-people game"", GOLF. The software adviser, when has nothhing to do, will practise the skill in front of the employees. Besides, you are given only 2 uniforms and are expected to wear for 5 days. Terrible... They become richer and richer and you will become poorer and poorer slaves forever. If you like this kind of company, Panasonic AV Networks Singapore is a place for you.

Panasonic Avionics is rated 2.6, almost an entire point lower putting the company in the bottom percentile Speaks for itself. Positive reviews are vague one-liners contrast that with negative reviews that are specific critique‚Äôs and paragraphs long. This dichotomy is an accurate reflection of the company‚Äôs culture. Some in comfortable positions are oblivious of market factors, customer complaints, and toxic culture. Those trying to effect change have to move over, around, or work harder to make up for those hanging out and getting paid. The result, frustration drives top talent out effecting a complete talent drain. If you are hoping to grow or work on challenging but rewarding projects look elsewhere. Business leaders are stuck in time warp regarding public demand for aviation connectivity. They still call their systems IFE [Inflight Entertainment] a reference to the hardware they sell, when hardware is becoming obsolete. Before applying to this company, I recommend you check out their ‚Äúofferings‚Äù page found at Panasonic.aero/our-offerings/ Airlines who are projected to take 10+ years to regain the passage volume they had in Feb 2020 are either removing these products, pulling services back in the house, or eliminating them in hopes of surviving. The passenger‚Äôs connectivity expectation in 10 years will look completely different from that of today. Panasonic Avionics business model was not to invest in R&D or innovated their offerings but to doubled down on customization, offering thousands of variations on the same product to blend in with the customers' cabin color schemes. This plethora of choice which captured a lion share of the market in the ‚Äô90s is the overhead turned millstone around their neck of today. Case and point even before COVID Panasonic Avionics had several rounds of layoffs in 2019 pre pandemic. Post pandemic their customers are fighting to meet payroll. For several years to come IFE will be nowhere in the budget discussion. The lack of innovation can be seen at all levels of the business. The perks offered, the evaluation process, promotion opportunities, the lack of training, and the leadership styles of managers. All stuck in a 1990‚Äôs mindset. Case in point up until 2019 the company had contractors on assignment for years at a time. The coworker I sat next to had been on contract for 5+ years before he was downsized at the last layoff. Shocked Panasonic Avionics hasn‚Äôt been sued. Can you say class action? Panasonic Avionics is a subsidiary of Panasonic and whole owned, meaning employees are not eligible for stock. Compensation is made up primarily of one‚Äôs base salary with a small yearly bonus that is derived on the profitability of the company as a whole. Not an individual‚Äôs contribution. Let me explain why this is a horrific situation should you join the company in hopes of growing your career. The compensation model uncouples performance and accountability at all levels of the business. Leaders are incentivized to maintain the statues vs investing in innovating for the future. And innovate is what Panasonic Avionics needed to do over the last 15 years to survive. This breeds a culture of apathy. Leadership coupled with company prospects are so bad I‚Äôm dusting off my resume and am in a full job search during the COVID lockdown. Time to get off the sinking ship.

In the last two years, they couldn't even figure out how to fix or alleviate the awful parking and bathroom situations. In fact, every inexplicable action taken simply put more burden on workers. After removing all the cubicles and sticking employees together elbow-to-elbow at long tables, we all started catching colds and getting sick more often.

In return, raises were cancelled and cute little music videos started appearing on the internal Yammer site, claiming we were all part of one big family and promoting solidarity. It was laughable; they simply couldn't do anything right to turn the morale ship around. The recent layoffs were handled with typical inelegance; no phone calls, emails or handshakes - just a mass Teams meeting with access cut off for an encore.

6745,6745,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,22/5/2010,A Very Poor Company. With High Turnover,1.0,"Pros: Pay Check Benefits are so so. Really no better than any other company of this size. A lot of employees come from very small aviation companies that offer limited or no benefits so the Panasonic benefits package tends to look really good. This really isn't true. They are average at best. In fact 401k matching contributions were suspended for close to 1 year.. Cons: After my first month at Panasonic Avionics there were almost too many red flags to describe. I was told the company was ISO AS9100 certified, yet I couldn't find any process to speak of. As I came to find out the certification was for hardware, not software. It's been 4 years and there are still no processes in place to speak of. The lack of any process was an unbelievable cause of frustration for so many people, in other departments as well. It created VERY long hours of work and stress because you spent most of your day chasing your tail rather than doing anything productive yet you were still responsible for your deliverables. When decisions were made there was no attempt to share these with other departments. The complete lack of communication was unbelievable. All this caused a revolving door where employees usually could only take about a year and then quit. This has slowed a bit but based on the feedback I get from other people, this is more to do with the economy than anything else. After all of this I started to question the capability of management and as I looked deeper into their qualifications, there were some, let's just say ""dubious decisions"" for hiring some senior managers. One could argue that this is just one persons observations, yet Panasonic Avionics continually score extremely low on customer satisfaction scores. One very large airline continually scores Panasonic as the worst of all vendors they deal with. My suggestion is to really think long and hard about accepting a position with this company. On a recent job interview that was for a company outside of this industry, the interviewer told me that he and another manager "" had very real concerns that I came from Panasonic . We feel that you have not been provided with adequate training or have developed bad habits"". I have been asked by several friends about going to work for Panasonic.

Dyson is full of amazingly skilled and dedicated people, people who have given their all to work at the cutting edge of technology and design without necessarily receiving the rewards their contributions deserve. Looks good on a CV - known for hiring / growing / producing some of the most innovative talent in the space.. Cons: One of the many failures of the current leadership is the inability to harness the pride that many of us felt working for this organisation. It is heartbreaking to see so many talented and dedicated individuals to be taken for granted then dismissed in order to make a billionaire owner more money. What you hear in the press is the effect of COVID changing consumer behaviour but you don't see the record Quarterly sales driven through alternative channels and the increase in revenues that follows maintaining high margins on the products. Smoke and mirrors follow the restructuring decision and at a time where the billionaire owner could have easily swallowed any minor loss rather than releasing many people who helped him build his money stacks. The executive leadership should be ashamed of themselves, devoid of any humanity or people focus they are bleeding any good will out of the business, amplified by a comms team that don't understand the impact of poor social capital. There are many reasons to restructure and I am not naive enough to think employees are owed a living but there are WAYS to restructure and this was not it. The new CEO has shown zero emotion in his action since taking charge. Whether it be ordering an entire workforce back to site in the middle of an epidemic, schizophrenic messaging about the health of the company, or the emotionless way he announced restructuring he maintains the same non-plus attitude to the people who have served the business with such integrity and dedication. There is a deep seated lack of trust throughout the business and this is obvious in the constant messaging about Dyson being a ""Campus based business"" meaning if you're not on site and not visible then you can't be trusted to complete the work. There are teams working all hours to keep the business moving forwards during this period who do so without thanks or praise but are essentially being told they're not trusted to do the work required.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.3215,0.175325758,negative,positive

The company does not care remotely about its people and inhibits any progression. It is run like a dictatorship where there nothing is done for the good of the people or the employees. Policy and opportunity for employees is taken away last minute on a whim from leadership. Despite claiming to have a non-hierarchical work culture, this could not be further from the truth, you will be silenced by those above you. Don't be fooled by the adverts of international opportunities or the opportunity to progress quickly - the only employees who progress at any rate are either as a result of nepotism or sucking up to superiors and throwing colleagues under the bus. If you are not either of these then it will be difficult for you to advance in your career. The pay is well below market rate for role and experience and HR are utterly incompetent, working against employees, lying and even going back on information provided in writing.

Cons: All of the pro’s listed above however are negated by a toxic work environment. The removal of autonomy, the clear and unapologetic stance on flexibility and lack thereof, the erosion of trust (truly disappointing post a record year in 2020) have made for the perfect storm of attrition and sickness. The latter being particularly alarming, people of all levels, length of service, gender, differing departments and locations are being signed off daily for burnout, anxiety and a whole myriad of mental and physical health issues that is not being recognised or addressed. The working pace has always been fast but the current situation with a rapidly dwindling workforce means that those left have a unrealistic and unmanageable workload. When management challenge productivity and results and you respond that there isn’t anyone left in the business to deliver, you are told to ‘make it happen’.

8265,8265,Dyson,6/1/2022,How to lose your workforce in 2 years,1.0,"Pros: I am genuinely saddened to witness the decline in this company over the last 2 years. It has gone from a place of excitement and inspiration to a place that seems to sap joy from you as soon as you walk in the door. My team and manager were the only pros but unfortunately they have also left or are leaving.. Cons: Unfortunately as you will see from other reviews, the real start of this decline came from Dyson's reaction to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, workers were able to have agreements with their managers that allowed them to work flexibly. This unofficial working from home took place globally and dyson went from strength to strength, however James Dyson appears to not have known this was going on. Apparently he believes that you can only be effectively working if you are sat at your desk 5 days a week because in an office there is 'collaboration'. Anyone not in the office is then threatened with disciplinaries. This shows a great lack of understanding of the world we currently live in and how teams work effectively. The majority of teams at Dyson work in multiple countries, communicating effectively on Microsoft Teams with people they have never met in person. Please explain how being in a Dyson office 5 days a week would aid with this communication. If they asked (which they haven't), they would likely find that most people do want to spend some, most or all of their week in a office location but everyone would like to be valued and trusted enough to make those choices with the support of their managers. Employees are not necessarily asking for anything new with regards to flexible working, they are asking to go back to how it was pre-pandemic. The decisions over the past 2 years are really starting to show. Over half of the team I work with have either left in the last month, are serving their notice or are off sick due to stress. This is not just down to lack of flexible working but also the general disrespect Dyson shows to employees. External recruiters are well aware what is going on at Dyson and are using it as an excellent opportunity to steal talent. On the flip side, recruiting into Dyson is almost impossible. Surely Roland and James have been made aware of this? The CPO Laura says she wants to listen but listening sessions with People team are cancelled/rearranged multiple times and listening only works if you actually act upon the information you are given. There is also a lack of respect for her own team - making decisions without consulting SMEs shows lack of trust and understanding. The turnover of employees in HR in the last year has been phenomenal. Is anyone questioning why this is?",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9939,0.121827606,positive,positive
8274,8274,Dyson,2/1/2022,Last year was bad and its only getting worse!,1.0,"Pros: - Free food and coffee was introduced in September 2021. It was a pre cursor to the mandatory on site attendance (see below) and whilst the food is pretty sub standard...most it is free - Loads of car parking space for those that drive. If you dont, there is a coach from Bristol or Swindon that leaves as the sun rises - Helipad at the back if you own a helicopter too - The engineers working on new products are smart girls and guys and it can be a great experience to see a product from inception to delivery. Cons: - Dyson is falling apart from the top downwards. The decisions/statements from James regarding flexibility for employees is well documented. Roland as CEO has been an awful appointment. Zero personal skills or charisma and speaks like he has little to no care for employees. Outside of having an exceptionally white shirt all the time, he has nothing impressive or inspiring about him. - No strategy just relying on the good old Dyson name. Those in the know are aware of new product delays, issues with logistics and increasing competition. Things that most employees cant control but are blamed regardless - Leadership is layered with people who have been at Dyson for 10+ years and literally following a set type. White, middle aged men who often believe their job title because it has 'Director' in it they know everything and wont mind bullying and suppressing people along the way. Unless you are a graduate... - Graduates are seen are the saviour to everything despite coming into Dyson with minimal experience. Flocks of experienced employees are leaving, arent being replaced and Grads are promoted into levels they cant manage, have no experience and only know the 'Dyson way'. Which for the record isnt a good 'way' to follow. - Zero flexibility despite what Dyson will say. All of the return to campus stuff has been documented but working from home does not exist here - Employees are quite literally leaving in their hundreds. The main catalyst has been the lack of flexibility and the forced attendance on campus. What Dyson ignore/forget/dont realise or appreciate is many people had pre-existing arrangements to flexibility when they joined Dyson, pre-COVID. These were removed which has added so much disruption to peoples lives at a time when we are going through a global pandemic. The decisioning and communications from HR and Leadership have been unforgivably bad - HR is getting strangled by management/James over employee retention, flexibility and are being forced to quite literally monitor people who do or do not swipe their access badges on site. I cant really blame HR as they are following orders, but the impact on employee morale due to this has been crushing - Huge blame culture across some teams. And those teams are often led by the aforementioned Director level types who only really know how to survive and stand on others at Dyson to get promoted to lead a team - Too much focus on shiny stuff and forgetting the important things that will drive Dyon forward. Communications from James have been limited to him talking about his new book (employees had the option to buy that for slightly more than you could on a big ecommerce retailer). Website is buggy, terrible to buy from but James announces a new virtual reality experience to save the day...which it wont of course as the number of people who use VR is only marginally more than those that use the helipad at Dyson.

They'll give you a free panini on your half an hour lunch.. Cons: The lack of flexibility is well known, but it really is crazy. The company don't believe working from home is working at all. Obsessive, incredibly untrusting, and laughing in the face of the pandemic. During my time here, this inflexibility has brought on much worry that I'd get in trouble for asking for days working from home that weren't ""valid"". I am not somebody who has ever really experienced anxiety before, so that fact alone should tell you how it makes staff feel. The lack of compassion is crazy. Need a bit of time at home to look after an ill family member? Don't be ridiculous. You'll get a day, maximum 2, and be ready to fight for that. The company simply do not care for you or your mental health. At all. Who can be happy, working for a company, knowing that the company do not care about your family? ""If you can work you must be in the office, at your desk, regardless of anything else going on"". It's a militant, oppressive position, which is making people leave by their hundreds. Its a problem which seems to be getting worse, rather than better. They're making it harder and harder to work from flexibly, which makes it harder and harder to motivate yourself to crawl into the office. Still, _some_ are allowed to work from home right now, due to the new government guidance! How nice is that? ... they will be back in too early, at the earliest opportunity, putting themselves at risk for absolutely no reason. Secondly, the Covid policies are remarkably contradictory. Staff are made to wear masks all of the time, including at the very spaced out desks. Marshalls storm around and demand you keep them on at all times. If you're made to wear masks all of the time because the air around your desk is unsafe, it doesn't sound safe enough to be in at all to me. Wearing masks permanently is very very cautious, but that is where the caution ends. Staff are forced in regardless of anything else going on, with no testing (there's nothing at all stopping infected people coming into the office), there's very little social distancing when you're not at your desk - The crushes at lunchtime are especially dangerous. Thirdly, the company have actively taken away opportunities to hear feedback from its staff, such as removing the pulse survey. Any company which chooses to close its eyes and cover up its ears from its existing staff should be a major red flag. I know why they don't want to hear it, but actively avoiding the feedback is a really bad (and dangerous) thing. Lastly, due to reasons I've listed above (and more) the the mood and the morale of the place, and therefore the culture of the place is absolutely horrendous. As described above, it causes tremendous worry and stress, and hearing stories about how the company has treated others in worse situations than me does not leave me with any reasons to feel excited or passionate about this company. People are leaving (or have left) in their masses, it amazes me that alarms aren't going off because the company is haemorrhaging staff. Long term members of staff, and new ones too. Maybe it's redundancy by exodus? There are companies doing great things right now, valuing and treating their people well. This is not one of them.

Most of the health and safety team have left so if you fancy a go making something really dangerous with some of the best resources around crack on. Also if you do it fast and dangerous you’ll be rewarded. I’ve seen more control in a pre COVID kebab shop at 2am on a Saturday. Oh and there is free food in the canteen, but it’s not exactly worth the price. You may have an impromptu long term stay on the porcelain throne if you win lunch roulette. Great regular chances to go for exercise, trying to find a toilet free can take a nice 10mins out of you day and boosts the step count. There are actually some genuinely nice people who really care about the place. They all sad to see the place they have invested years in being carelessly trashed by a maniac and an eccentric billionaire.. Cons: Honestly I’m not sure where to start, it’s quite painful to be part of, you feel a sinking feeling turning up to work knowing that there will be some wonderful cluster to deal with by the end of the week. It might be another classy announcement to get back into the office again or your sacked. Sent of Friday night after hours! Or maybe we’ve just made some of you team redundant surprise! Oh and btw we still want to double dyson so if you can make up the slack that would be grand. Or there is flexible working dears but if you actually use it we will hunt you down and demand to know why you weren’t on site even though we told you you could. Or the latest don’t to what the government tell you, we know best, stay working at your desks we are watching. The way employees are treated is quite historic, you will be a number here. You will be paid below the industry average because you are working for the great dyson and you should be thankful that we let you in the gate. I’m not sure if we actually have any great products in the pipeline, most are just paint jobs or reactionary, not the great inventions that they once were producing. It’s all about producing something in such short time scales that everyone on the project goes out with stress. If I were betting I would wager that the talent that has left has struck a possible mortal blow. There does seem to be very little pre thought to some of the decisions so you will learn to be dynamic with the truth when asked. The last belter, don’t spend anything until next year. That stopped most of dyson RDD for 2 days until someone saw sense. It’s like someone left Roland in the pub on Friday night with his phone and told him don’t txt the company. It’s all quite sad as this once great company circles the drain, hopefully it’s not allowed to sink but my advice, don’t join, but watch as it might get back to being great again.

Cons: Basically feels like a car crash where every day you see more damage and realise how bad it is, with no plan to fix it: - Board unable to make decisions and just say yes to James and Roland - No direction of where Dyson needs to be in 3-5 years and how they going to get there - A lot (can repeat a lot) of outsourcing to multiple companies across a number of departments (HR, IT, Finance ....). No internal knowledge and capability. Lots of 3rd party staff working at Dyson, who do not care about the company and just follow a simple process as their contracts dictate. - Make operating model changes every 18 months but never actually land the new ways of work or the new structure and just causes more ambiguity, less accountability and makes it more difficult to move an inch forward - A revolving door of people leaving across all departments. And since they have draconian HR policies the roles are not being filled. This leaves those individuals who are still in the company covering for 2 if not 3 people as the board and leadership teams all expect the same amount of work and output no matter how few people are left.

8321,8321,Dyson,24/11/2021,Not the company it once was.....,1.0,"Pros: Dyson recently introduced a whole range of new benefits to UK employees recently, including free lunches/drinks/fruit, plus things like on-site GP, hair dresser, EV salary sacrifice scheme, but these are viewed as little more than bribes to soften the blow of making it mandatory to be in the office 5 days a week. Unfortunately the fruit rations run out by 10am, the meal queues are huge, and the quality and size of portions has declined dramatically since being introduced. Many of us would rather pay a few quid to get a decent choice!. Cons: None of the above however can make up for some of the shocking HR policies implemented by the business in the last 18 months, which have served to create an incredibly negative atmosphere amongst the staff that are still here, and driven away the many fortunate souls that have sought alternative employment recently (or simply quit without jobs to go to or retired early!). The worst example of this for me was when the Exec team (or more likely JD) decided to force all staff back into the office during the first lockdown, despite the government clearly stating that anyone that could work from home must do so. We all received an email late on a Friday night telling us we had to return to the office on Monday, however this was followed by another email on he Saturday saying that this was no longer the case - basically due to a staff revolt! That was definitive proof that JD valued the success of his business over the health of his employees and their families. That was the moment that I decided I no longer shared the values of the company had spent years working for and contributing to. Since then, things have got progressively worse - staff satisfaction surveys have been abandoned so there is no way for employees to express their views anonymously (except via Glassdoor!); 5 day attendance on campus is now compulsory, with all staff monitored by HR for attendance. Morale is also further impacted by the unrealistic targets that the business now is tasked with achieving over the coming years due to the 'Double Dyson' strategy, which basically means doubling profits, doubling the amount of new projects, whilst at the same time halving the development time and cutting costs. With so many experienced and knowledgeable people leaving (or have left), this makes this even harder to realise. Dyson has always been a fast paced and dynamic place to work, but this new strategy seems doomed t failure. Unfortunately all this can be traced back to the very person that made Dyson such a success in the first place. All decisions on HR policy and working decisions seem to lead back to his door, with both CEO and CPO either unwilling or unable to influence him. The working conditions are completely out of step with modern practices, and it is clear from what internal recruiters are saying that this is having a serious impact of being able to both retain and recruit staff. And I haven't even mentioned yet the fact that it has been many years since we actually launched an innovative and successful new product! The failed Electric Vehicle project burnt through half a billion pounds before being scrapped, and as a reward for leading this terminated project, JD installed Roland as head of the entire company! It does feel to me as if Midas has lost his touch, and I think the next few years will get increasingly tougher for Dyson from a financial performance perspective.",Head Office Employee,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,objective,neutral,,,0.7901,0.025034678,positive,positive

The people remain great but most are, quite sensibly, leaving en-masse.. Cons: Where to start... I wouldn't be able to fit this all in one review. However here are some of the most recent items to give you a flavour. They are generally focused on the great work of the 'back to work' functions. In the UK, they have established 'punching in', such as would be found in a car factory of the 60s. The owner is genuinely worried that people are taking advantage of him, that they have aggressively been making people come back into the office (#campusculture), even when there are multiple COVID cases reported each day. The 'Return-to-work' scheme therefore was rolled out like the annual 'back-to-school' campaign at ASDA, without any of the jolliness. Workday absence status is matched to your security pass being used on the door. Everyday the people function have to manually go and chase those who haven't clocked in to see what they are up to. If you still don't have a valid reason (there aren't many these days) then you are put on a naughty list which is sent to the CEO and owner. Work from home/flexible working is NOT allowed. If you need to not go to the office one day you need to log it in the system. Car breaks down, kids are sick, doctors.... Dyson have to know what you are doing. It reminds me of being at school again! To top it off there are also monitors who patrol the office and cafe asking if you are vaccinated and that you need to wear your mask at all times. In Singapore, teams are again made to go in despite a government mandate stating work from home is the norm. Instead they have to submit a covid test every sunday before the week of productivity ahead. Those who want to leave the country are actively and aggressively discouraged through threats of losing their job or having to take unpaid leave. COVID updates on this are sent in a very militant manner. Although travel is perfectly legal now from Singapore, albeit with caveats and process, people function are asserting their power with no regard for peoples personal situation. If you need to do a work from quarantine, this is not allowed (who knows why when we have been working remotely for a year)... To travel you are forced to sign a document which states the right to terminate you and not be paid if there are any changes to your plan. Then a member of the executive committee have to approve it to 'grant' you the permission to leave. As an aside, the culture has been all but crushed in the company. There is no spirit, no leadership and a lack of direction on the most part. Moral is through the floor and at the same time we are being told we need to double the profit in 4 years. However, no one knows how we are going to do it. I could go on, but that's enough for now.",Engineer,"Bristol, England",reviews,objective,positive,,,0.8398,0.175445088,positive,positive

Good, experienced people leaving all over the place.

I left almost solely for this reason and wasn’t given an exit interview. None of my peers were. Staff were never consulted about how they wanted to work post pandemic.

Cons: Where to start... Its been quite a tragic journey for Dyson over the last few years, its really lost its way. It no longer cares about the individual (you or I), or the customer. It simply cares about making more money, and if that means sacking people in the middle of a global pandemic, then so be it! A lot of people on here point to Robot Roland (our CEO), which I don't think is particularly fair. This all stems from James Dyson. As he's got older and richer he's become more and more disengaged from the company. He's got much greedier, arrogant and bitter, (you know what they say, as you get older your worst traits come out stronger). Back to Robot Roland, think of him as an empty suit. He takes his orders in the Boardroom and duly issues them out, even if they are beyond what's legally allowed (like forcing staff back into the office during a national lockdown). What our CEO and Founder have failed to realise is that we are not robots, we are not here just to make a bitter old man richer. So we have started to push back on the nonsense, which they don't like, so they're now doing round after round of redundancies (even after promising there won't be more).

Cons: Upper Management - A private company with a very massive wealth gap between the owner (James) and the people who perform the day to day work.

Cons: Don't know where to start with this place... Senior management can't manage they are literally promoted on length of service and not on ability. They will say you need to be in role at least 1.5 years before promotion/changing roles, however this isn’t the case, so its misleading and dishonest. Work-life balance is a myth in this place, and you are expected to work all hours with literally no preparation or acknowledgment for your efforts. Leadership (chaos) under new CEO Roland "" robot"" Krueger has shifted heavily towards cost saving and cares more about profit than wellbeing of staff. He has a personality of a rock and after making 900 staff redundant he spent literally 1 minute talking about it, and quickly switched back to their fantasy about competitors and sales targets. Forcing staff to campus during pandemic and during lockdown (you will disciplined if you refuse, engineers have complained to guardian about this!). Literally made staff sit in outdoor tents for lunch just so they can get staff on campus during pandemic, my colleagues’ hot breath was more effective than the heaters in that tent. Chaotic and reactive is understatement, literally everything is done off the back of something happening in the business, so its never planned for or proactive. For example, they told everyone to come back to site after 5pm (after 1st lockdown) on a Friday to start again on Monday, only to reverse the decision 24 hours later cus they are so out of touch with people’s life outside of work. They bang on about these three values which literally make no sense and senior management do not act these values so how can staff follow this, please someone tell me!!! Culture of blame and no accountability, managers would rather throw you under the bus to save their own back than stand up for you. Literally no focus on diversity, apart from 3rd party cleaning staff who are lovely and the Reaction to BLM was embarrassing, company did nothing apart from an email weeks after events. No head of diversity and inclusion in 2020!! Wouldn’t be surprised if this company hired a white, 50+ private educated man for this role… lol Literally no woman on the board, so its just a bunch of men making decisions, how do they expect change and alternative decisions and outcomes?! The most siloed business on planet earth, I get product confidentially, but the communication is non existent between business areas and departments. Dyson will bang on about “change”, “fast paced”, “not for everyone” and you need to “be dyson”. However, this just covers up the sheer incompetence of the business. The reason they ask about managing change at interview (atleast 5 times) is because they u turn more than boris johnson, and cant make a decision so you have to deal with it. It not about changing with the times and technology as you would expect. The induction is the best ive been to, they show you the science, investment, engineers, products, let you take apart a machine, but in reality this just covers up the bad side of the business and after one month I was like wow they really sold me a lie in that induction. Dyson invested in a multi-million pound HRIS system because there were no global processes or about 20 systems in use globally prior to 2020. However, the data was so poor and they provided no training the system is a complete mess after 1 year and managers don’t know what they doing or how to use it. They recently layed off 900 staff “due to covid, when in reality this was because the company hired for too much growth which doesn’t exist. Some staff even layed off twice in 2020 can you imagine the stress of this? However, despite the above some of the people are wonderful and they keep you going during the daily chaos. The engineers create some amazing products, however I expect many staff to leave this place after their actions in 2020. You need to have strong mental health to take a career at this place cus boy it will break you down day by day until you cannot take it anymore/ cant perform your job.

It just ends up embarrassing and the brand has been severely damaged over the last few years. The new CEO is here for one reason, cut costs and increase profitability so one man can still have his dividend at the end of the year. There is a clear lack of regard and lack of skill around how to keep people motivated and inspired. People given 'high-performing' rating for 2019 performance had their bonus cut to standard at the very hint of a global crisis, and as always, most found out from their friends or rumors rather than official communication from the management. I understand this in another company but when its the UK's richest man saving a few million, it's a bit miffing. Then again, this is the same man who later ditched 900 'sales and repair' staff in the middle of a recession, blaming COVID . The way it was announced was just as calculated, a ten minute webcam briefing from the CEO explaining that although sales are good, we need to get rid of people. Turns out only around 50-60% of those were 'sales and repair', lots of project managers, engineers, heads of department, quality, HR etc. were swept under the rug. The latest embarrassment is the debacle surrounding 'return to work', first there was the u-turn, now there is daily reports where managers are asked daily on the percentage of staff they have back in the office. Functional leaders are spending there days chasing people into the office so that they don't get pulled up by the management.

Asked us to come into work in May despite government advice still being to work from home. Email sent after hours on a Friday, to come back in on Monday. Officially they retracted it, but offline they still made us come in. This was 8 weeks before government advice changed. - Have misled the company and press about the redundancies, suggesting that retail was struggling due to COVID. Most of those made redundant aren't retail people. Loads of engineers were made redundant. They've used COVID as an excuse to thin the herd, cut costs and line James' pockets even more. Just be honest about it. - Robot Roland. Yet another Dyson CEO claiming that they are the one who truly does care about people. And then proceed to do the absolute opposite of caring for people. Monthly business updates delivered with no charisma or interest - the redundancy announcement was abysmal - delivered with absolutely zero empathy. I've never experienced such an uninspiring leader and don't feel good for the future of the company if this is the best we've got. I don't think he cares though. - There is a complete mismatch between the way Dyson portrays itself as an employer vs. how they actually are. They want to be taken seriously as a tech brand, but offer none of the forward thinking opportunities or ways of working that tech companies offer. As a result we can't recruit young or fresh talent, so we do the same things over and over again. It's been made clear that we are not a work from home company whilst lots of other companies right now have learned during COVID that they can trust their employees to work remotely, and that recognising this wins their employees' respect and loyalty. Dyson has none of that trust. We're told to make sure we take holidays and rest, but if you go on holiday and have to quarantine on the way back, you'll need to take that as unpaid leave. - Lack of diversity at leadership level is worse than ever. Middle aged white men jostling for power and calling all the shots with no interest in ideas or input from anyone else. And we wonder why we can't bring in a young consumer or make more innovative products. We don't have the empowerment or opportunity to speak up or try new things.",Commercial Manager,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9972,0.113655844,positive,positive

Most are just glorified salesman who have blagged their way up the ladder. Good coffee and a nice location in the countryside. I met some decent people here but most have now left.. Cons: Staff moral is at an all time low; the VP’s, Director’s and CEO constantly bang on about how much money the company is making & how amazing we (the staff) are, however they still don’t reward appropriately or appreciate the staff when it counts. If you don’t fit the Dyson mold of being privately educated, have the gift of the gab, and preferably partake in upper class extra curricular activities then you’ll struggle to get on, as only the favourites get promoted. You could work for years to improve Projects and delivery but get no appreciation. Obsession with rig building, reviewing things to death and Visuals overshadow the not so glamorous Engineering guts of the project. I believe the Upper management fundamentally don’t know how to run a company properly as most have never worked anywhere else. The place has out grown most of them. Many decisions are made on egos and personal gain, not for what’s best for the Business. Middle managers are obsessed with building their own empires and pushing themselves up the pecking order, rather than doing what’s best for the Business. Even if your manager fights your corner it will be likely be ignored and overruled by a Director. In summary a shiny pretty enticing shop front, but a rotten core to this Company, run by people that really don’t seem to care about the staff at all. If you’re privately educated and can give a good salesman pitch with all the jazz hands you’ll get on; if you’re a proper hard working Engineer who delivers good quality work and you are from a non-priviledged background then you will struggle to progress – Go and work for a proper Engineering company instead and actually be appreciated.",Engineer,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9692,0.223062016,positive,positive

To put this into perspective - they are still trying to solve/develope knowledge on a problem that exists across multiple electronic/PCB projects for over 5 years which other ""technology companies"" would laugh at.

Cons: Dyson have been paring back staff reward for years in order to control total staff cost. First they removed performance related pay rises and gave a higher bonus. Saving the company a fortune but hitting staff salary progression. Then they froze promotions. Saving the company a fortune but hitting staff salary progression. Then they decided that they had better look like they care about staff reward, so introduced a new performance conversation culture and made all the right noises about rewarding high performers and awarding smaller pay rises and bonus to underperforming staff. Sounds good. The trouble is, the process to decide who gets what is not based on objectively measured contribution, but on a few managers in a room ranking everyone in their team based on what they can remember them having done in the two weeks before that meeting (forget everything they have achieved in the last 12 months). Then, even if that list is somehow a relatively fair reflection of the high and low performers in the team, it then goes to HR for 'calibration', at this point if there was any objectivity it quickly gets steam rollered by the overriding strategy of the exec to reward as little as they can possibly get away with. The more you earn, the less likely you are to get a higher % payrise or bonus than the 'default' award (because that's more expensive for Dyson). Junior staff are most likely to get extra and that way Dyson can boast that they rewarded x000 staff for high performance... and still keep the cost to a minimum. They look like they care about staff reward and thus keep the staff sweet... Happy days!

IT seems to be improving by upgrading ancient laptops and operating systems, this time next year there should be the right systems in place to do your job.. Cons: Even though it’s the people that make Dyson, no one cares about the people and the executive team continue to make decisions without thinking about the impact on people. Recent changes to staff sales means the majority of Dyson can’t afford to buy the great products. You’re expected to travel for your job yet the new travel policy and restriction on direct flights means you’re expected to be away from your family for longer and when you eventually get to your destination the new meal allowances don’t cover 1x meal and 1x soft drink in a standard resturant so you’re out of pocket.

This brand has an awful processes that bottlenecks with one man, meaning good designers and engineers with ambition leave. If you stay too long you won't be able to function in the real industry. So the best leave and the ambition lacking get promoted early, accepting they are there for life and that the slow, bottleneck approach is good. This in turn means they will not understand why so many people are upset with the process. Also, not much point complaining as they know that all issues start and finish with James dyson, and he won't change. -This is a company that has got lucky a lot.

9344,9344,Dyson,27/2/2017,New Product Innovation - Not Particularly Interesting,1.0,"Pros: Some of the most intelligent, interesting and dedicated technical people you'll ever work with. A uniquely successful UK company that truly values engineering and innovation - when approached in a specific way in certain areas. You'll be part of a unique private company that is getting bigger and stronger. Great for students and inexperienced engineers and designers. Above average basic holiday allowance. Flexible start/finish time - mostly to avoid car park gridlock. Plenty of opportunities to learn new practical skills. Firm grounding in real world engineering principles and a 'seeing/building is believing' approach. New campus buildings are a step in the right direction for staff work environment. Daylight and outdoor areas now available to staff based in new non-converted factory buildings.. Cons: Cold, ambivalent treatment of people. Paranoid levels of secrecy and security. Think 1984. Lack of meaningful performance incentive with below market rate pay on a global scale. Engineers are much more highly valued in other developed countries and industries, a UK problem that is taken advantage of here. Pervasive arrogant attitudes and hubris due to recent success of company. Superiority complex. Believe they are still an underdog startup company whilst now being a large global corporate production and marketing machine. Even at quite senior levels, you are likely to be a tiny cog in this machine. If you want to follow your own path this place isn't for you. Ironic given how the founder became successful and how regularly you are told about it. Process/review driven culture fosters slow pace of development. Senior management are receptive to sycophantic behaviour traits. There are 'chosen ones'. Entitled sociopathic males appear to be treated favourably within RDD. Dull work environment stifles creativity of individuals - have to work in a certain way. Limited freedoms and few opportunities to grow as a professional in the wider world. Can't work flexibly from home or off site if work in RDD - mostly for security reasons. Unless you are one of a very select few in RDD, you won't be allowed to pursue your own ideas, you'll be working on other people's. The company is inward looking and in an isolated location - feels like a purple 80s prison on the edge of the Hot Fuzz film set. Your commute will be long.

Sadly, the aforementioned list of pros is both terribly short and but a prelude to a laundry list of cons.. Cons: Let me be your personal Paul Revere. The British are not coming; they are here. Take a position at Dyson, but know you are signing up to fight a never-ending, non-revolutionary war. Con 1: Spin It I have worked for big brands in the past, but never has perception reigned so supremely over actual productivity and results. To succeed at Dyson, you must PR yourself, pillage coworker's wins and claim them as your own, and stay well beyond the standard workday simply for the sake of appearance. These characteristics are bred and lauded by senior leadership. Thus it is no real surprise that there is a cutthroat, toxic environment brewing - one where employees are forced to climb over one another like a horde of demons freshly unleashed from the bowels of the underworld. Con 2: Culture, Smulture Get ready to get bopped over the head with a slew of haughty phrases and lofty promises. At Dyson, employees are pitched on an open office environment that promotes communication, unlimited advancement opportunity and flex hours. Be warned: those are but traps. And crucially, it gets worse. The walls in the US office ooze cocksure quotes that are passed off as bits of the Dyson culture. They might have you believing you just beamed aboard the innovative express. Trust me, you have not. While the whiz kid engineers in the UK might be whipping up a sexy knew cordless vacuum - excuse me, ""machine"" - that will outlive planet earth, know that the US office actually crushes creative thinking. Oh the sad, sad hypocrisy. Con 3: Dyson's ""Visa"" Bill If you have read other reviews of Dyson on glassdoor, you have undoubtedly noticed one pattern that has literally repeated itself for years: ex-pats are given nearly every single leadership role in the US. This is likely do to the extreme success that the blokes and birds have had over the past few years. Utilizing their extremely limited knowledge of the American sales/marketing environment, they have managed to exponentially shrink US market share. (fancy claps) Con 4: Revolving Door The real Dyson culture promotes competition and lacks teamwork, transparency and overall tact, so it should come as no surprise that turnover is high. How high?

Though I've not been in many other companies of employment, I honestly believe Dyson is one of the few companies where employees and general community feel is genuinely a highlight to working here. Everyone here is competent but not overly serious. You can have a laugh with line managers and department heads. Everyone trusts everyone to be doing their job properly, and rather than being reprimanded - mistakes are instead seen as areas of improvement and looked at from all angles, not just the individual. Everyone understands they happen. - Yearly Dyson Challenge that pits teams against one another to develop some innovative mechanism to overcome that year's challenge be it building a cart out of cardboard or hovercraft out of a dyson motor! - Average age is 25 - it's like being back at university! - Huge community focus with clubs and activities and events all year long organised very professionally. The Annual Christmas fancy dress parties are legendary - Competitive pay - Independence to get on with your work, or have a huge amount of help as you so choose. Everyone wants everyone to succeed, no one is out to 'get you'. Most criticisms come from people simply ensuring you're working safely. - Everyone is friendly and approachable - Recently introduced paths to professional accreditation (i.e. chartership) - Massive recruitment drive. Cons: - A fair amount of red tape and admin work, though no more so than any other large company I would imagine - Pay could be slightly more than 'competitive' to ensure retention. - While the 'underdog' attitude serves to embolden us, it can make us complacent not thinking the same large company attitudes should also apply to us. - I can only speak from an engineer's perspective. There is a divide, due to secrecy, between us and other areas of the company. - Expanding very quickly, a lot of moving around and nothing ever stays set for long.

Very well equipped workshop, and easy access to advanced prototyping capabilities. Nearly everyone is friendly and easy to work with.. Cons: Huge open plan ""office"" (warehouse really) is quite loud due to all the nearby vacuum cleaner testing. It can be cold in winter. You can't carry any holiday over New Year as of 2014 (most companies allow 5 days). Parking is horrific. Traffic when leaving is also bad (everyone leaves at the same time).

And instead of promoting from within, they hire outside talent (for mgt positions) who know nothing about Mediacorp. This company is one-dimensional and reactive. When an industry competitor starts an initiative, they follow suit. Never realizing it doesn’t work for our business model. Don’t even get me started on their Merger&acquisitons dept — acquiring companies that are so unknown. Waste money and resources. Management have no idea what to do about the change of the media landscape. Instead of growing its products, it seeks revenue through outside partnerships with non-media brands, which means more work for internal staff who are already very short-handed. Again, they don’t hire extra manpower to take these projects on. You never know what you’ll be doing tomorrow: it’s shifting sands here. Management will shut down projects/depts whenever they feel like and kick employees around and make them double up. HR dept is useless. I don’t wish to elaborate. Don’t fall into the retrenchment trap here. If you don’t receive any severance within 24hrs of being made redundant, don’t expect to ever receive it. They will transfer you to a dept you hate. And if you are offered a 2mth trial in a new job role, I guarantee you won’t get severance at the end of it.

CEO has been on the job for a year now and nothing impactful has been visible. Various business groups has reorg in recent months without transparency and proper communications to entire company and creating more interfaces and problems for other business groups. Procurement and IT are a mess, nobody owns anything and everybody knows nothing. So many people acting busy, and not delivering value to the organisation and yet taichi problems to other business functions. Goals for FY are complicated and lacks transparency and accountability. Projects are messy too, complicated, under managed, in-fighting, budget overrun, delayed and still not accountability.

With a boss who is MIA, things don't get done, you have to scramble to get everything settled, sometimes even at a higher cost to get things rectified. Of course she doesn't get any blame - it's her staff (us) who gets reprimanded by the head of department for not staying on top of things. At the end of the day, your work is not even appreciated and the ones who are rewarded are those who have connections with her (yes, more recommendations from the same clique).

Wow change. The way to evolve. If you're not chinese, be warned if you don't work for the malay or tamil channels. Open racism to non-chinese. People speak in meetings in chinese sometimes when it's an ENGLISH channel. This is ridiculous. Most people have no professionalism or ethical code of conduct. A lot of politics in promotion.If you kiss ass, you get rewarded. If you don't, then you're blacklisted. Everyone is sheep. All followers. Creativity and collaboration are crushed. You do it one way. That's it. If it's not the supervisor's way, it's wrong. Even when it's obviously the opposite. Everyone likes to do things in an old fashioned manner. Very resistant to change. Long hours. And this is not due to your ineptitude. You have to spend long hours cos other ppl are slow and it affects you. You have to stay around cos they are slow and poor at their jobs. If you leave, then it shows you don't care when in truth you could be smarter and more efficient. So while others are taking breaks, making mistakes and gossiping, you're actually doing the job well and quickly. Majority of employees are ""yes men"". So if you're smart, independent, creative and are great at what you do...tough luck. People who have been with the company longer think they know more than you even if you have an extensive resume or overseas credits. So be warned. If you're an entry level employee, expect to be treated poorly. You're just a glorified intern. Horrible pay. They pay you really poorly. It's a monopoly so they try to undercut you tremendously. If you are interviewed, ask for the salary range at once. This will give you an idea of how low it is and if you should waste your time. There is no transparency between the top, middle and lower tiers. There is always mismanagement and poor communication. The separate divisions are at odds with each other. They don't know what each other do and they all feel like their department is more important. People loose their cool and professionalism and resort to arguments and yelling. Vulgarities are common. So it's really a case of the inmates running wild. Most employees think they're special cos they work for the main broadcaster in Singapore so they talk down to people who are new.

HR seems to be less dodgy then two years ago - at that time they would go behind a department's back to hire someone at lower than agreed pay.. Cons: This is a chaotic place to work - improvements are incremental, painstaking, and seemingly at the whims of senior management, irrespective of their relative positive or negative impact on employees, morale, or organization. For example, the company decided to stop illegally asking their casual staff to work more than 35 hours per week or 8 hours per day without benefits. Their course of action was to immediately restrict the hours worked by these staff - thousands of workers - with less than 24 hours notice. The communication flow for this change was atrocious, resulting in a work environment full of suspicion and resentment as thousands of workers suddenly were pay cut and thus suspicious and resentful of the company and full time workers. Months later, this toxic environment continued to be needlessly uncomfortable and unproductive.

Cons: They will work you into the ground, and it's all corporate-level work. Benefits are not that great, and it feels like they indirectly get mad for not being online at all hours. I worked a lot of weekends and even at times working for 4-6 weeks straight. A lot of the employees work so hard just for internal content or higher-up presentations for Samsung. The workflow process is one of the worst I've seen. On my first day there, I was immediately put to work within my first 5 minutes and told that a project needed to be done by EOD. I had no time to adjust, and now, that project is long gone and it felt like it was for nothing. There are plenty of times where teams are at the office until 2-3 AM while higher up's head out early. I remember a time where I was staying late while the head of office and CEO left to go to a baseball game, but before they left, they came in and bragged about it and also mentioned it was free. There was also another time I was struggling to take equipment inside and the CEO just walked by and offered no help and did not even acknowledge me. People bow down to him because he is supposed ""Koren Royalty"". No opportunity to grow, more of a stay in your line work environment. Hints of some racist, sexist comments made by director-level people, who happen to be white. Not much diversity, either Asian or white. Deadlines are unreasonably tight for no reason, and it seems like other teams in the company don't take others' time into consideration. A lot of the creative work is developed by people who don't have a great professional background or seem to be more business people instead of creatives. Whatever salary you are offered go ahead and break that down by 50-60 hours a week and see how much you getting paid, don't base it off 40 hours a week. 40 hours is a dream work week, but even then, the stress is too much for non-competitive pay.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.936,0.066720292,positive,positive

Cons: Well, how to start... - I've been ""sent home"" after discovering a member of my team was ""undermining"" me (harassment, mobbing, call it however you want) for more than 2 months: this person was literally choosing his designs over mine (instead of being a team I discovered we were competitors working on the same brief......), simply because he was more ""senior"" than me. His designs were presented to the client using my visualisation skills, without anyone ever really acknowledging it (our manager at the time was NOT a designer...) and keeping all the merits for himself. Yes, my designs were not chosen from my manager, but from my colleague (who didn't want to show me his works to not ""influence me"" while we were working but was constantly looking at mine while I developed them). When I accidentally discovered what was happening (him chosing the designs and not our manager), I went to HR and senior management. The decision was to keep him and not renew me at the end of the probation for ""not being a good fit for the work"" (I simply faced him after discovering what was happening and refused to help him anymore... and started leaving the office on time! He kept on picking his own designs and said I wasn't good... again him, not my manager!). - the other member of the team and the project manager knew what was happening, none of them moved a finger (or tried to approach me, or gave me any advice, for what matters) - the management is non-existant: my (not designer) manager was constantly insulted from my colleague (on the day I started even) and kept telling me to try to get along with him.... When I left I had to tell him how he was called and was really surprised to hear it... (a leaving present given, for once) - never left the office before 9pm - constant turnover, the good ones rarely last stay after the probation (or are freelancers looking for something else...). People who work there for long are definitely not happy and probably just lazy to find another job. - only koreans and “lickers” really ""progress"" (as if there was anything better to get into apart from a better salary...) - everyone constantly complains about his/her bosses, colleagues and the other teams. Like, everyday? - no teamwork, no enthusiasm, no creativity. There is some talent but usually leaves as soon as possible. I've never felt so bad in any other work experience, never met so many people hating their work/bosses/colleagues, never felt so sad for not being able to find not even one important thing to keep with me for the future. Sad because after 1 month I had already started looking for something else.

Mainly due to the endless pivots and short-sighted ideas the founders attempt to launch and believing the management they've put in place will deliver, when in reality they are not suited for their roles or the objectives of the company.. Cons: The culture of the company is the worst I have seen. Toxic, and it is a pure reflection of the many insecurities the founders have and their urge to make an exit rather than building the company they boast about in the townhalls, and no one believes them. This comes partly because they do not have management experience, and mostly because they've put in place managers who merely act as ""yes-men"" and are grossly incompetent. This results, in managers becoming extremely political because they are continuously scrambling for resources to cover up for their lack of knowledge. They started with an amazing product to bring down costs vs big telco players, but it was as clear as daylight that the big players in the market took a nanosecond to adjust prices and compete. Now Circles is not growing its subscriber base since mid 2020, furthermore it is disregarding it's other markets (Taiwan is closing) because they realized that the MVNO model doesn't work any more. Take a look at their marketing strategy, it is as simple as throwing money at subscribers to keep them. Not sustainable in time. This has pushed the founders to pivot to the B2B model and become to big telcos, what Grab & Uber are to the ride hailing industry. They boast about their Circles-X platform and how they can solve the 20-year old problems the industry has had. However, as we all know, all of Circles' tech is based on Oracle (+90% of it). Even to the point that Circles doesn't even have a registered IP because it did not develop anything. Then there's the CSOP plan which everyone bought into thinking they had upside in the company. Only later to find out that the plan had many irregularities, specially after the company brought in a private equity fund. Word around is that CSOPs are worth nothing because they are not tied to equity, but also that the Founders have cashed out in the latest funding round. This is very frustrating. Then there's HR & Talent, which continuously keeps on walking out the door because they become frustrated or because they are tired of the politics and having to deal with the incompetency of managers and the lack of willingness of founders to listen to alternative points of view. This only leaves the wrong type of people in the company, or those who need to stay in it because of EP issues, and that number is significantly high and founders use that as leverage when negotiating salaries.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.9869,-0.005344561,negative,negative

There is a high chance that they might fire all the engineers in the Singapore office or force them to leave.

11538,11538,Circles.Life,22/9/2020,[BEWARE] If you are smart run as far as possible from this company,1.0,"Pros: *May get to work on a variety of things. Breadth wise learning can happen depending on your interest and the level at which you join. But, if you are looking to sharpen your skills then you will get disappointed. *People and culture team - the only ones still trying to create positive environment in the company *Town hall meetings *Wednesday Lunches[depends on your taste though] *On time salary *Marketing team - Backbone of Circles. Cons: I wish I could say take this big feedback with a pinch of salt and there are shades of grey here and there. But, when the complete environment is shady, it's my duty as an engineer to warn others. Here are some factual points - 1) Management - Manager's who have joined recently seem to be better than the existing lot, let's wait until they become part of this system, or leave. Old ones just benefited and became managers because of sticking with the company for a long time and don't have the people management skills, or right technical skills, or both management and technical skills 2) Politics - From top to bottom it is there. It's not an engineering company but a political setup 3) Pressure - You won't know the reason but there is a constant pressure 4) Poisonous - The more you stay in this company, more bad it will do to you personally and professionally 5) Learning - They give few ""chosen"" employees some online courses coupons, others are neglected as they are just labours. You need to be favoured by your manager for this, some genuinely hard working guys are also given this benefit, but the ratio is [1:5::good:mediocre] 6) CSOPs - BIGGEST SCAM, in the last one year policy w.r.t. awarding of CSOP's was changed almost every month. It was done to deny you CSOP's in every way possible 7) Exits - Many people were handed pink slips. People were fired in the worst possible way, no professionalism even when parting with your own employees. Looking at the mayhem, and the unstable environment, many good people quit themselves out of self respect, as they didn't find this company worthy enough to put their career on the line 8) Marketing heavy - It's a big marketing setup where starting from founders to CTO they know how to sell subpar things at good prices and raise funding. Check the advertisements of Circles.Life in Australia and cat videos in Singapore, if these resonate to you, then please go ahead. Also, I hope you are smart enough to have figured out how there are many 5 star ratings [no brainer - added by HR team]. Look at recent exits in the HR team and you would know the situation 9) Bonus and Hike - 0.5 months of bonus to most, 1 month bonus to chosen ones. No hike was given to most citing different stories, no consistency even among stories 10) Space cadet and explorer - ANOTHER SCAM. If you feel hard work can help you become one, you will be disappointed. Most of the people who have got these fancy rewards won't even find a decent job in a good company outside. It's just a mechanism to retain people who have created dependency in company 11) Growth - hahaha, no growth in any terms. No clear career progression roadmap defined. Every month starting last 1 year a new timeline was given about releasing career progression and role definition guide 12) Hierarchy - People report to anyone and anyone can become manager/lead[literally anyone], true for more than 75% of the lot. Look at the profile of the people with whom you are supposed to work, or to report, before you accept the offer. Also, refer to point no 1 when making the decision about joining this company 13) HR - Bunch of spineless people. Worst I have experienced so far in my career, they are the ones who just want to lay policies to fire people, and don't care about how to make people grow. But, I pity them, due to the condition outside they are just doing everything asked to save their own jobs 14) Employee benefits - No insurance for family, it only covers employee, no memberships, no education support, monthly phone bills can be reimbursed [here comes the surprise - you need to submit bills every month for the same, thing as simple as this in a TELCO company, where founders/CTO in one breath compares Circles to FAANG is not automated] Circles.Life company motto is to run fast and the company name has circles in it. Company name itself should give you a cue, as a circle means no direction. Fill in the blank puzzle for ""Physics"" fans ? When you run around a circle with the speed of light you end up ...?... yourself. If you have figured out the blank, you have already proven that you are smart. I don't need to convince you more about what to do or not to do. If you want to work in a madhouse, like to work with people who would talk about random things which wont make any sense, want to learn big technical jargons, want to learn about how not to build a product (engineering as well as product wise), then you are lucky to have found this company.

11545,11545,Circles.Life,31/7/2020,Circus Life at Circles.Life,1.0,"Pros: Can't think of much - maybe just the perks of having your telco bills paid for?. Cons: TOXIC WORK CULTURE: You're expected to work overtime and on weekends/holidays. It has become such an expectation that it has permeated throughout the whole organization. It gets frowned upon or even ""escalated to your superiors"" if you do not provide ""timely support"" (even outside of working hours). NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE: Especially if you're at the working level. You can find yourself easily working 18-hour shifts on weekdays. Meetings are arranged on weekends and sometimes on public holidays. If you do see any other reviews that claims that there is plenty of work-life balance here, they are probably at the top managerial level where they do all the talking and none of the heavy lifting. CLUELESS LEADERSHIP: The CEO is known to prefer yes-men over those who are opinionated but genuinely have good ideas, but the founders and senior management have little clue on how to bring the business forward. The lack of business acumen and relationship management is appalling, as the constant cherry-picking and indecisiveness have caused the company to lose out on potential growth opportunities and new revenue streams. Instead of rectifying this, the leaders have been sugarcoating the lack of growth with big words and fluffy ""motivational speeches"". CAREER REGRESSION: Earlier in 2020, the company laid off a huge number of employees due to over-hiring from the previous two quarters, but chose to blame it on the employees for being poor performers. Many co-workers joined for a specific role but was eventually asked to work on a totally different scope as early as one or two months into their employment.",Product Manager,Singapore,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.6968,0.059156217,negative,positive
11554,11554,Circles.Life,22/5/2020,Considering? DON'T. You have been warned.,1.0,"Pros: Stocked pantry with snacks, coffee machine and tea. Amazing company LinkedIn profile that makes Circles look glorious on the outside. Telco bill reimbursement, group medical insurance.. Cons: Too many to list down. but here are a few. Things started going downhill since last year. Glassdoor rating was as high as 3.7 just a year ago, but now a pathetic 2.4 and this is NOT for no reason. - Multiple “restructurings” happened and people got laid off since last October. Used to joke that Thanos appeared in Circles because every few weeks there were layoffs, but it has since evolved into a fear culture that these jokes aren’t even funny anymore. We were tricked into believing every single lay-off was “the last one” in the company’s exact words. And then it happened, and happened, and happened again and again. - High turnover rate. Most good people are leaving the company because of the turn of events that have happened. Many are looking for an exit. Ask around, even recruiters from other companies know about it, we were told during interviews with other companies. - Don’t trust anything the recruiters tell you if it is not written in your offer letter. Don’t be naive. Make sure everything is in the OFFER LETTER that you sign and not only in the email, or worse still if it’s just verbally told to you. When questioned why salary adjustment was promised by recruiters but not granted, the company’s response was “we did not commit to that if you check your offer letter”. Wow, amazing. You won the legal game. Many people even for those who have worked for >1 year did not enjoy any salary adjustments last year, and for those who got it, it was way lower than market rate. Do you want your pay to be stuck at the same range even after working for a few years? Think twice because when you move on to other jobs, companies will base their offer on your current pay, which means you are kinda stuck. - Management here abuses the word “ownership”. Taking ownership means you are expected to firefight, churn and deliver within tight timelines and most of the time losing your work-life balance. The CEO said firefighting is in our company spirits. What? - Process changes all the time without elaborate planning and systematic execution. You are told to follow this process today, two-three weeks later they would change their mind and tell you to follow another process, and the cycle keeps repeating. You will find yourself being caught up with processes instead of focusing on learning and developing your skills in the company. - Insanely KPI-driven. If setting exceptional goals to appease your boss and working overtime to meet KPIs is how you enjoy working, welcome to Circus. Oops I meant circles. To people who are considering to take up job offers from Circles, if you do not want to constantly worry about job security, fearing that you will be fired anytime after seeing your colleagues being let go one after another, being stuck in an infinite loop of working like a robot to deliver within tight timelines but learning nothing, no pay increment, DON’T JOIN. You have been warned. Fresh grads especially, please look elsewhere. You deserve better. Don’t be tricked by the glorious social presence of the company. Always try to speak to engineers (engineers on the ground, not managers, not recruiters) in the company first before joining one, and for circles specifically, you will understand why there are so many negative reviews on Glassdoor.",Software Engineer,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.8981,0.070366193,positive,positive

11595,11595,Circles.Life,30/4/2019,Wouldn't recommend this as a place to work,1.0,"Pros: This is no doubt a very ambitious company. They truly focus on- and deliver what customers need. Management is also very performance-focused, but maybe too much (more on that later), there are some very smart and hardworking people in the company. Unfortunately, my experience working here had more cons than it did pros.. Cons: Lacking transparency - They claim to have transparency in the form of sharing business results/performance goals/roadmaps, but many important business decisions are still made behind closed doors. You hear of/see new ""business partners/consultants etc"" joining the current team with no proper introductions made, and Management only addresses these when people start asking questions/express unhappiness. Reactive, not proactive. Feedback - Don't know if they still do it now but the co-Founders held ""open door sessions"" and encouraged employees to come in and give honest feedback. Pure lip service. They listen to reply, not to understand; most of the time are very defensive, making excuses, and not committing to change things at all. This behaviour was also present in the HR leadership then. Poor management culture - You'll see many other reviews here talking about their miserable management culture. (Applies to majority of Managers, not all) Extremely focused on results, yet they don't celebrate how we get there. Minimal appreciation for team members; once you reach your goal/target, another is put in front of you for immediate action. This is not wrong at all, but without proper and SINCERE appreciation shown, it's bad for employee motivation. Micromanagement is experienced by MANY teams, which trickles from the co-founders themselves. They also seem to think monetary rewards = employee motivation, which brings me to my next point.. Inadequate HR leaders - The leader(s) in the HR team (or as they call it internally : ""People & Culture"") need to seriously rethink their understanding of employee motivation and building a positive workplace culture. High level of unhappiness and turnover, overall workplace culture is not ideal, some senior employees bully the junior folks, yet HR doesn't do anything when these are reported. Also, I can say for a fact that most of the positive reviews here are indeed ""planted"", and were arranged by HR themselves. There are people hired into the company because of connections with Founders, without any formal selection process, and HR just goes ahead with no (or minimal) objections. I do wanna point out that this team has grown considerably large and pulled in a few new talents in lead positions. Hopefully this is for the better... As mentioned by a few others here, this place has a disproportionate focus on growth/profit, over employees. Understandable in a high-growth startup, but that doesn't mean you ignore employee morale and feedback. Turnover is not an issue to management, they have the mindset that people are very easily replaceable. I mentioned before that this is an ambitious company, but it borders a lot of times on being arrogant/obnoxious. Management consistently boasts about how the company is ""more than a telco"", and puts themselves in the ranks of Grab, Gojek (in terms of their success in Indonesia) but honestly they haven't really developed that much as anything more than just a telco. And with this same arrogance, they assume people are dying to join the company, but at the same time not offering competitive packages at all. Office location is also simply not attractive, but again, Management sees this as a non-issue in attracting talent. They really need a serious reality check. (If you've seen their latest Marketing stunt on the papers in Apr 2019, dissing their competitors in such an unprofessional way, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say they're obnoxious) Overall, from a consumer POV, Circles.Life is a top contender.

They can fire you anyday without giving any prior notice or warning. They will take you to a meeting room and will ask to submit your laptop and leave immediately. Such is the unprofessional behaviour of the management. And it was happening for people from entry level to Director level. 4) I was part of the Bengaluru office which had about 35 employees when I joined. During my tenure of 3 months, I saw about 10 people quitting themselves and 15 people getting fired. I was not any of the fired ones, but I quit myself seeing the unstable nature of this company. Nobody was sure what is going to happen next. 5) During my tenure I also saw office boys and talent acquisition people getting fired. It was like nobody was spared. 6) Looks like they were planning to close off the Bengaluru office, but the way it was done was terrible. 7) All this started happening after the new CTO joined the company.

Lack of information sharing between teams, sometimes even among team members, where as long as you weren’t in SG office, you were considered as “must comply by all or any means.” Often creating last-minute requests and calling said requests as “urgent.” Mind you, this didn’t happen in my team but has happened to another colleague in another team. 3. High-level management sets up SLA for alerts then creates alert policies that are shorter than said SLAs, thus showing lower MTTA numbers. 4. Some managers, when asked questions or criticized in monthly town halls, choose to give light answers or ignore the questions entirely. 5. Axed the people who helped launched locally in TW and AU, then called them redundant.

With this in mind, execs are usually treated as non-human that does not deserve enough rest time or personal time. They are expected to reply to messages or emails instantly, regardless of the time of day or during off-work hours. When conflicts or faults arise at work, those who speak the truth are humiliated, blamed, and cursed in front of everyone. This is one of the reasons why your people LOVE telling you lies. They'll lie to your face every time because you will punish them for telling the truth that does not make you happy.

The company also does not provide much enrichment and they promises on a one to one coaching and mentorship, but in face one will be thrown to the sea to survive or drown.

She was also persistently micromanaging every aspect of what I was doing and HOW I was doing them. (I achieved my highest weekly target during her one week absence) To add on, I overheard my branch manager giving an earful to my supervisor and right afterwards, my supervisor did the same to me in almost the exact same words the manager said to her. It seems that the blame is passed down in this MLM-ish style business model. 2. Outdated information systems - Only a single work station was available to a team of about three to four employees. There was a function to search for candidates in the company's candidate database but it was not made aware to me until after a month into the job. Even so, most of the processes were done manually with pen and paper (we had to bring a pen and a notebook around to seniors in the morning to get client job orders and then they would each send us emails with the exact same details later in the day).

Will cheekily ask you out for lunch dates. If you do not suck up to him, forget about any promotions - 3 people share one computer and one e-mail address - Very hierarchical. You take a cut of your intern's pay, your Director takes a cut of your pay, then the owner takes a cut of your pay. Leaving the actual candidate with almost 40% of his pay gone - Expect you to stay in office till late. If you even dare to step out of the office before 6pm it's GG for you the next day, the bitching will begin - The environment is so political. It's straight out from the set of Mean Girls. Everyone is bitching and stealing candidates from one another and when confronted about it, will plaster on a fake smile denying any involvement - Weekly meetings with the director are like throwing two lions into a pit. Director will play one person off another - Nearly once a month will have team bonding events which further shows how hypocritical the environment is. No one actually likes one another. I strongly advise against joining this company, especially the Ngee Ann City outlet. If you have any semblance of morality, you'll find this job hell. I joined HR because I wanted to help people get jobs they like and interact with candidates, but instead was told to lie about the job scope, pay and even company to get them down for an interview.

After a while, everyone gets sucked in and ideas just die a natural death because it doesn't pay to do (or say) something different. To get anything approved, an approval paper needs to be written and typically spans tens of pages, at least 8 drafts, a minimum of 4 or 5 approvers, and a huge ""throw-back"" process where you start again from the drawing board after jumping through hoops and selling a month of fake smiles, you realise that the 5th approver did not like something written or suggested in Page 4, Paragraph 38 and it trickles down back to you after getting a earful from the afore-mentioned 4 approvers. Sa-Mu-La with a full load of eggs on your face. Top-heavy. Highest turnover is at the bottom rug, where people do most of the work. The top does most of the talking, and the talking never culminates with a specific strategy, so the working level is left confused, disoriented, and takes the blame for wrong execution of a non-concurrence in direction. The blame-game culture and the ""ivory tower"" concept holds very true here. The working level toils with daily guess-work while the Head level continues to smile at each other and goes for ""friendly"" lunches. Too much respect for rank.

There was no progress , workplace seemed to be in a long sleep mode and a result Mapletree had no positive news to share on India. 2.Extremely toxic working environment 3.Employee-HR engagement ranges from very slim to zero and as a result most of the issues go unaddressed 4.Senior level employees are seldom respectful towards junior level staff and often try to muscle in authority to look down upon them. 5.Extremely flaky HR policy. 6.HR should emphasis more towards ensuring a safe work place for women employees and must take adequate measure to discipline anyone found guilty of misconduct. 7.There should be more opportunities for learning and development and employees should be given the opportunity to move to other teams upon receiving prior training and subsequent evaluations.",,"Tampa, FL",reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9873,0.183334721,positive,positive

Cons: - Toxic working environment. Backstabbing and gossiping of the team by the 2 male staff (Manager and VP) is rampant. And doesn't help when such behaviour is being condoned (due to favouritism towards male). Whatever work / personal remarks made (even during lunch), these will be reported upwards. - Lack of technical knowledge. Risk and control concept is weak amongst the leaders in the department. Old school way of auditing, where most of the time you are checking if there are sign-offs only. The use of data analytics is almost non-existent. Audit issues are weak. - Backward working style. Everything is via hard copy, you are expected to photocopy every single document you review for all your audit samples. Micromanagement and lack of trust, all emails are to be vetted at least once (sometimes twice) before it can be sent out. - Working late is deemed as hardworking.

Cons: Generally a managed by a ""dictator"". All staff generally try to please just one person. The top guy allows, does not discourage or to a certain extend, encourages political fights among the different persons. A few members of the senior management at the HQ level that covers functions for the entire group across the world are known to create troubles for everyone. Rather than finding solutions, they generally either identify things that aren't so-called perfect (could come from local regulatory problems or different business view) and claim the local teams to be idiots, or make decision solely based on their experience without considering local constraints. They simply don't listen. Culture generally does not encourage staff to help each other out. Each staff should take sole responsibility of its project no matter how complicate it is. Company does not care about whether the right resources are put in place to support you. Incompetent leader in certain country brought in to solve problems but ultimately enlarged the problems with no visible solutions HR team works under a mission to cut costs, rather than maximizing staff's utility level with the resources they have. When negotiation for employment terms, HR is under a mentality that ""if you don't ask, I won't give"". Idiotic travel policy. Personal trip cannot be mixed with business trip. For instance, if one planned a personal trip to, say, London in 2 weeks and happen to have a last minute biz trip came up there for 2 weeks. One is required to come back (say, Singapore, the HQ), and then go to the personal trip on a plane ticket of its own.

Not because formal professional development programs, HR policies, or a feeling that the company truly values you and your colleagues. If anything, the exact opposite is true. Rather, you will grow because you will be disappointed. Laughed at behind your back. You won’t get that promotion after years of hard work. The politics coming from the C-suite will paralyze any good ideas coming from you or your colleagues. Executives will care more about which airline or hotel they choose for the points than any of your ideas. You will also learn what it’s like not to be trusted. What it’s like when senior leaders hold months of ‘strategy’ meetings behind closed doors resulting in ended partnerships, severe layoffs, and weeks of self-doubt. You will have to find ways to tell potential students and partners that Navitas, as a global education company, no longer prioritizes the largest destination for international students—the United States. You will learn to play serious office politics. Will you become a favorite of those in charge? How far will you be willing to go to do their bidding? And who’s to say that this is worth it—especially if student recruitment numbers plummet? Have a back-up plan if you take employment. Don’t stop looking for new opportunities, and make friends with those that have been through the ringer the last few months. Reach out to former employees, instructors, and partners that have been made expendable.. Cons: What others have said about a company losing its soul is absolutely true. If you are a potential employee, part-time faculty member, or potential university partner, go somewhere else. This is a company facing threats from Australia (Thanks Camino!), the UK, and across North America. While US enrollment numbers have fallen by 50%, others like Shorelight Education and INTO have actually grown by investing in their people and technology. Just look at what happened at the University of New Hampshire, one of Navitas’s oldest US partners before Fall 2019. UNH was Navitas’ highest ranked US partner, with a new president that was eager to build a stronger private-public partnership. He even wrote a book about it, “The Insider’s Guide to Working with Universities.” Did Navitas executives read it? Buy it? Even look at the outside cover? I don’t think so. Not when they’re too busy cutting jobs, damaging the reputations of former adjunct faculty members, and trying to squeeze out a positive EBITDA. Its North American leadership team should resign out of sheer incompetence, lack of empathy, and a long list of broken promises. When you take a job, and you’re told you need to move and you don’t—what kind of message does that say to others that did?",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9618,0.057076446,positive,positive

Cons: They will portray that they are friendly and care about their staff when in reality it is just a front. My first impression about them was great, but soon I discovered that it was all fake. If you do not fit within the same personality as all others you will be seen as a ‘bad employee’ and managers will actually call you rude names behind your back. They will try to push you out. It’s like a popularity contest and if they have an issue with you, it doesn’t matter how good of an employee you are or how well you work with the students. The management is horrible, they do not have sufficient training, people with no people skills get promoted and their opinion will always matter more than non management employees. There’s no point involving HR, as they will just back up managers and come up with excuses. There’s literally no one to turn to if you feel discriminated against, they will give you a general email of how they work for staff wellbeing and that any discrimination allegations must be not true. The pay is dreadful, they will not pay overtime, even when you have done 12 hour days. And if you have done overtime and the following week you need to leave an hour early, they will make you work it off and you cannot use the overtime hours you’ve done, as that is just expected from you. When I compared the pay with other higher education establishments, the difference for the same position was around £7000 less a year. There’s barely any training. They will throw you in the middle of everything and then tell you off for not knowing how to do things correctly. I wish I was exaggerating about that.
