Headcount continues to drop at an alarming rate, and there is little or no effort to replace leavers, causing those left behind extremely disgruntled and disillusioned. 2. Base salary is so much lower than the market rate that without significant bonus to make up for this, the low total remuneration will not attract or keep any talent. 3. Staff morale is at an all-time low. Most seem to look forward to a good retrenchment package after the anticipated merger with Sembcorp than to a good career growth in the company. No one believes in the latter anymore. 4.

7179,7179,Keppel Offshore & Marine,13/7/2022,Not a long term job,1.0,"Pros: You get to see a lot of aspects of building a vessel , it‚Äôs a good place to practice different skills in our field. Cons: If you are in production it could be years before you get brought on to the actual company until then ur labor lease hitch means no holidays or pay for them , no vacation pay , crappy health insurance, and just unappreciated as a worker and treated like garage . Not to mention the only way to move up is if your buddies with management or your related to them (which almost everyone has family working there ) . It‚Äôs like high school dumb drama all over again. And they change hours and shifts on a whim and don‚Äôt tell us til the day before if your lucky . We were given a days notice that we were coming off day shift and heading to nights , and 3 times since I‚Äôve been here they decided we were required to stay extended hour with no notice , the order came down after lunch. It‚Äôs just and unfair place to work , they treat us all as replaceable and have threat us on multiple occasions with those words . Also there is no safe place for your tool , even if they are locked in you locker , ppl just break the lock and that your tools and safety / security does nothing . This is the worst place I‚Äôve worked and I would recommend to anyone .",First Class Marine Electrician,"Brownsville, TX",reviews,subjective,negative,,,-0.6369,-0.083632479,negative,negative
