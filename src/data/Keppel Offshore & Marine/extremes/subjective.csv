The company embodies the adage ""why hire 10 people when you can get 5 and distribute the task among them?"". Guidance is rarely provided and often the seasoned workforce have learnt that the best way to solve problem is to deflect, avoid or redirect it to other people. In short, working hours are depressingly long, there is virtually no work-life balance (despite what the company tires to promote) and the workload expected to carry is crushingly large. The company will mould and shape you from soft pebble into rough, hard, bitter, black granite.",Mechanical Engineer,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,
7181,7181,,Keppel Offshore & Marine,13/7/2022,Not a long term job,1.0,"Pros: You get to see a lot of aspects of building a vessel , it‚Äôs a good place to practice different skills in our field. Cons: If you are in production it could be years before you get brought on to the actual company until then ur labor lease hitch means no holidays or pay for them , no vacation pay , crappy health insurance, and just unappreciated as a worker and treated like garage . Not to mention the only way to move up is if your buddies with management or your related to them (which almost everyone has family working there ) . It‚Äôs like high school dumb drama all over again. And they change hours and shifts on a whim and don‚Äôt tell us til the day before if your lucky . We were given a days notice that we were coming off day shift and heading to nights , and 3 times since I‚Äôve been here they decided we were required to stay extended hour with no notice , the order came down after lunch. It‚Äôs just and unfair place to work , they treat us all as replaceable and have threat us on multiple occasions with those words . Also there is no safe place for your tool , even if they are locked in you locker , ppl just break the lock and that your tools and safety / security does nothing . This is the worst place I‚Äôve worked and I would recommend to anyone .",First Class Marine Electrician,"Brownsville, TX",reviews,subjective,negative,
