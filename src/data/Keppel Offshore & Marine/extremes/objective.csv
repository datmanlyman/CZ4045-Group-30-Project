7162,7162,Keppel Offshore & Marine,9/7/2013,Typical chinaman company,1.0,"Pros: Can learn a lot, deal with many types of people across various levels and get to understand many equipments. Good exposure for Engineering leads. Huge bonus of 8 to 10 months, inflated by a fairly low (in terms of oil and gas companies) monthly salary.. Cons: A typical day begins waking up at 5.30am to catch the bus. Work starts at 7:30am and ends at 4:30pm officially, but many are expected to work 6:30pm or even 8:30pm. The company embodies the adage ""why hire 10 people when you can get 5 and distribute the task among them?"". Guidance is rarely provided and often the seasoned workforce have learnt that the best way to solve problem is to deflect, avoid or redirect it to other people. In short, working hours are depressingly long, there is virtually no work-life balance (despite what the company tires to promote) and the workload expected to carry is crushingly large.
