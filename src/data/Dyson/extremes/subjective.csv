211,211,212.0,Dyson,2021-05-31,Steer away from this company if you wish to grow! One of the good for nothing company to work for,1.0,"Pros: Only Pro is really good salary & incentive structures during season period. But that's also a con, more on it in cons segment. Employee discount is one of the best but who cares as their products have become the worst quality that requires maintenance & service every 6 months. What good is a product if it doesn't function without issues. Yearly increments are upto the mark.. Cons: The list is huge!! 1) No Work Life Balance - They expect you to work 24x7, at least according to the Customer service Director. You get constant calls on your day off (week-day) asking for queries and requesting to take up a cx call just because it's escalated! All meetings are scheduled on your week off and you are expected to join them! That too at 8:30AM in the morning! Who sets an official meeting at 8:30 AM when the working hours are from 9:30 AM thay too on a day when so many are on off? If you don't join the meeting, you are constantly called upon on your phone to attend the meeting by your manager,. The meeting lasts for 5 minutes with only good for nothing data discussed. You'all share Pulsey survey regularly on how to improve Work Life balance, but what implementation is done? 2) You don't get Sundays as week off, I mean come on! All services are over video call now, and they think customers will return back the machine if they don't get service on Sunday! The customers can wait a day if they are informed properly! The Director sets an example from his initial days of starting work that we have to be available all the time as this ensure we grow in our careers. He says that we used to hog our back off, roaming on bikes & public transport to service customers. Oh come on, times have changed, so has quality of service provided. The only thing that hasn't changed is the Old man mentality of management. 3) Inexperienced Managers: The company exploits a lot of fresh out of the boat graduates, and hog them to work round the clock as the company knows that they are paying good money and get the employees to work like slaves. Immediate team managers are just promoted doesn't know anything with lot of ego issues. They expect you to do anything they ask for, including micro-managing their work when they are in-efficient in managing. Managers do not know how to manage a team and they think we owe our lives & time to the company. Things used to be much better during the initial launch of the company. But now, with so many efficient people left, especially Rana, the company's standards & quality have gone down the drain. 4) Promotions: Don't expect promotions until 2 years, and even if you get promoted the job description is the same. Why have a promotion then? Your appraisals are solely based on biased feedback from managers and KPI doesn't matter anything. Only petty politics & favourable people get promoted. Even if you achieve your goals, it's never high enough for the company. 5) Contact center team is one of the worst in the industry. Insufficiently trained & brought live & direct to work. And they mess up big time, you end up doing half their work. For every repair call, they add ESCALATED. 6) This is one of the worst companies to work for. There's no growth even when you achieve all KPI's. Your manager, who used to be Field Service Engineer first thinks that we are working in this company for the our own good. Little does he know that we are working for the betterment of the company at the same time. Novice manager, with ego issues, no clear communication provided and withholds information that needs to be circulated. Incorrect Job Descriptions: Service Engineers? Really? Should have named the title - Demonstration Technicians. B.Tech graduates are meant to attend video demonstrations of Dyson products to owners? Why? Why not save up money and hire non B.tech graduates? How do you expects employees to stay and work up the ladder when there's no opportunity to grow? Service is just a mislead here. The North team, is a JOKE. Bunch of people who cares of only their schedule and move on requests to others. Can't handle anything on their own.

Base pay was paid out on time.. Cons: Management constantly monitoring you, minimum wage pay that increases $.40 cents a year, absolutely no opportunity to move up, ridiculous uniforms that choke your neck, they claim 3 discount codes a year, but NEVER GIVE YOU THE CODES. HR does not respond to emails and there is no phone number listed. Management goes on constant smoke breaks, arrives hours late and leaves hours early yet claims they work, required to welcome every single person into the extremely busy store while also walking everyone through every single product. Night shifters are required to take trash down to the most disgusting and smelly placed in the world, where all the malls trash goes. Shipment starts at 6am where you have to unload thousands of pounds of product. Management holds you in the store for no reason until 11pm even though you’ve done your closing duties, just because “we’re all required to leave at the same time”. They promise a monthly bonus that they keep changing the terms to so that you almost never actually get it, even though we sell 600k a month of product for them, doubling their goals.

Cons: Although the world has changed massively and many big froward thinking companies have adopted a hybrid working system, Dyson has ignored 99% of its workforce and opted to send eveyone back into the office 5 days a week. Going back into the office isn't that bad is it? It is when the campus is based in the middle of absolutely nowhere. There is no train and no regular bus service, oh yh and the internet is awful. The closest cities are Bath and Bristol, these are both an hour drive away. This means you have c.3000 people driving for c.2hours a day just to get to work... The insane amount of time lost and the awful impact on the environment this is having is just so backwards. During the pandemic and the WFH era, Dyson had a record breaking year, performance can't be used as an excuse to send people in. The excused used is 'wE hAve a CAmPus CulTUre' - where? What makes this a campus culture? Google has a campus culture, they provide reasons for people to come to the office.

Cons: The culture is very repressive, this is not the place where you feel your opinion or you are valued beyond your ability to drive cost savings. It is strange that Dyson would hire qualified experienced individuals from good background and task them with menial and low-level work. Rudeness is tolerated here by the top level.

Cons: The company ethos and hidden oppression where to start. They advertise how good Dyson are but once your in, you have left your old job and soon realise its a bad move. They have cameras every where to monitor there employees, this is clearly said as they expect you to steal there ideas!, Your emails are monitored just to see what your sending, no trust from the company there, You are not allowed to use the phone or talk to people out of your team, as you might tell them something ! Each project has a project review and your not allowed to tell them any negative issues, only report good items or totally lie about things going wrong . There is no trust from the management they think your there to steal everything. They even tell you they plan to take you to court when you leave if you have ever sent anything remotely to do with work to any one out of Dyson, this includes your home Email so you can work on it at home. So if you think you can do some thing easily later at home to catch up some work, they will take you to court when you leave. Check the Bristol Crown court, they are often listed there for this type of thing, its not illegal but you get stuffed with the court costs. There is a huge amount of staff turn over as lots of people hate working there, but dont know it till there there. Lots of people have depression here, all due to the nature of the company.

Cons: Avoid the floorcare teams. Managers asked, or suggested team members to be back for work during a pandemic while they themselves are working from home. They made it seem like there is a choice, but with the tight and set to stone deadlines, you will suffer the later you got back to the office. Little appreciation in all the hardwork you do - managers just want to see the final result and if it affects their project budget. People are constantly overworked and tired due to the shortening of project timelines and launches leading to overlaps between new and old projects or the same person handling multiple projects.

Genuine opportunities to innovate in some areas. James is a thoroughly nice guy to work with. The majority of people work really, really hard.

The management at the engineering has absolutely no idea that the relationship between productivity and hours of work follows the economic law of diminishing returns. Productivity will peak at a certain point and then it will decline. By working too long in a day, it gets to the point where you will achieving nothing. However, it is not the case in Dyson.

This makes it a really great place to work. - Dyson is very good at hiring smart people who want to work together and help others to learn and develop. I came for the technology but have stayed for the people. - The focus on building the best product possible for our users and being prepared to really invest in that is something which I love as a product person. - We are starting to embrace more flexible working in the software engineering functions now post covid, which is really helping with the work life balance and collaboration across timezones. - As it is still run very much like a start-up there are loads of opportunities for real autonomy, particularly if you are prepared to break some rules (which is often encouraged and supported) - The problems that we have to solve are often technically very hard and have not been done before which is great - Change is a constant at Dyson and we are not scared to make large changes which means you don't get stuck in rut. These changes are often good, but even when they are not you don't have to wait long for it to change again for the better!. Cons: - As it is a start-up which has grown quickly there are quite a few supporting functions and procedures which haven't kept a pace with this. There are some growing pains still to go through but the trick will be to ensure that we still keep the nimble ways of working too. - The need to keep our IP as secret as possible has lead to an unconscious lack of sharing between engineering and other functions even when they are not discussing anything secret. This is something we need to get better at. - More flexible working has not been adopted company wide yet. - The split between New Product Innovation and New Product Delivery isn't ideal, but this is a hard balancing act. How do you give people enough space to truly innovate without having to support getting a product into production, yet still learning all the lessons so your next product is better. We seem to be iterating to a better place though. - Being an entirely privately owned company the executive team do not have as much autonomy as in some public companies.

I left the company toward the end of 2020 and I still get text messages from the leadership/employee group-text-messages, asking me to work overtime. The communication is terrible, their internal system and SAP software hasn’t been updated since Dyson came to the US and there’s zero work-life balance. Also the training is almost non-existent. Seriously; it’s bad. If they made you take 1-2 chats at a time maybe the job wouldn’t be so bad; but 3-4 is the expectation and lucky for you their internal systems don’t work fast enough to allow you to help that many customers at once. Want your boss to be texting your personal number every day you’re off asking if you can “just help out a few extra hours”? Then this is the place. Want to work for a company that says you’ll get sales bonuses and great pay, but fails to tell you you’ll also be taking 4-6 tech support chats at a time that will give you horrible reviews making you ineligible for any bonus? Then this is the place. Seriously it’s bad. Everyone just lies to their customer to tell them what we they want so they leave them a good review and they can get a bonus, then if you’re the poor chum that gets the customer next and have to tell them the previous agent was incorrect; guess who’s getting a bad score? Yup you are. Also they tell you it’s easy to make a bonus since it’s all based on your scores that guest give you. But they don’t tell you it’s on a 0-10 scale and while you need to make a 78 for a bonus that if anyone gives you a 0 that score is actually super weighted and tanks your entire month. So even if you get 40 people to give you a perfect 10 aka a 100% and you get one upset guest whose mad at someone else setting the wrong expectations or something way out of your control; if they give you a 0 there goes your entire months bonus.

Turnover rate is extremely high, the HR may not be telling you the full picture of why the predecessors left the team previously. Most of the people in the company are newly hired and they do not know what they are doing. The design of the product keeps changing with no end to when the design can be fixed. Everyone felt pressured to meet the deadline of the project. The PM or DM will press on the downstream and expect everyone to meet the launch date of the product even the design is still not fixed and confirmed.

They hardly understand what is RnD role. They hire at kent ridge location and then all of a sudden you are asked to work from pioneer location. They also have location in Malaysia. The singapore side supports Malaysia. If not covid situation you shall be travelling on weekly basis to Malaysia. Your life will turn to hell by working at such unethical place.

Dyson is full of amazingly skilled and dedicated people, people who have given their all to work at the cutting edge of technology and design without necessarily receiving the rewards their contributions deserve. Looks good on a CV - known for hiring / growing / producing some of the most innovative talent in the space.. Cons: One of the many failures of the current leadership is the inability to harness the pride that many of us felt working for this organisation. It is heartbreaking to see so many talented and dedicated individuals to be taken for granted then dismissed in order to make a billionaire owner more money. What you hear in the press is the effect of COVID changing consumer behaviour but you don't see the record Quarterly sales driven through alternative channels and the increase in revenues that follows maintaining high margins on the products. Smoke and mirrors follow the restructuring decision and at a time where the billionaire owner could have easily swallowed any minor loss rather than releasing many people who helped him build his money stacks. The executive leadership should be ashamed of themselves, devoid of any humanity or people focus they are bleeding any good will out of the business, amplified by a comms team that don't understand the impact of poor social capital. There are many reasons to restructure and I am not naive enough to think employees are owed a living but there are WAYS to restructure and this was not it. The new CEO has shown zero emotion in his action since taking charge. Whether it be ordering an entire workforce back to site in the middle of an epidemic, schizophrenic messaging about the health of the company, or the emotionless way he announced restructuring he maintains the same non-plus attitude to the people who have served the business with such integrity and dedication. There is a deep seated lack of trust throughout the business and this is obvious in the constant messaging about Dyson being a ""Campus based business"" meaning if you're not on site and not visible then you can't be trusted to complete the work. There are teams working all hours to keep the business moving forwards during this period who do so without thanks or praise but are essentially being told they're not trusted to do the work required.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,positive,

It went as far as HR flagging if WFH is booked more than once a month, the line manager will receive email demanding reason of letting his employee to WFH. Asian authoritarian culture is getting more established and it will only get worst. The red line is being tightened as the rules cascaded downward on the hierarchy. If you have forgotten your badge, you are not allowed to be in the build. You will be likely asked by your line manager to travel all the way back home to get your badge to clock in for the day. Even if you have to take a cab to do so if you rely on company bus service. Very poor roles and responsibilities definition.

Senior managers, heads and vice presidents do not have a clue what is going on in regards to technology. They are only interested in gossips and politics. If you raise any concern in regards for being treated unfair then no body will listen to you or they might try to dismiss you as well. If any accident happen like you miss your flight or your kid is gone sick then you will have to book your holiday on that day either paid or unpaid. they are very strict on work on site. They claim a free hair cut but you will get an appointment after 3-4 months. Managers can gang up against one person very easily to give him/her hard time.

The company does not care remotely about its people and inhibits any progression. It is run like a dictatorship where there nothing is done for the good of the people or the employees. Policy and opportunity for employees is taken away last minute on a whim from leadership. Despite claiming to have a non-hierarchical work culture, this could not be further from the truth, you will be silenced by those above you. Don't be fooled by the adverts of international opportunities or the opportunity to progress quickly - the only employees who progress at any rate are either as a result of nepotism or sucking up to superiors and throwing colleagues under the bus. If you are not either of these then it will be difficult for you to advance in your career. The pay is well below market rate for role and experience and HR are utterly incompetent, working against employees, lying and even going back on information provided in writing.

8176,8176,,Dyson,6/6/2022,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,1.0,"Pros: Free 4 or 5 options for lunch on constant rotation. Free hot drinks.. Cons: LACK OF FLEXIBILITY: Zero tolerance for WFH despite it not adversely impacting many roles. Yes there is a flexible working policy. No it wasn't communicated. The few allowances for WFH days are often not accepted by the WFH HR police. The real policy is worked out through trial & error, and warnings for breaking policy limits which are not communicated. Very cloak and dagger approach. Dentist appointment? - You're expected to take holiday. No fuel at the pumps? - You'll be given a warning for ""abusing the flexible working policy"". Sick but well enough to slog through for the company working from home? - Unacceptable reason to WFH. 100% unwillingness to negotiate with staff on this. Zero trust or respect for staff. COMMUNICATION: No company goals or objectives flowed down. Policies lack clarity and do not say what they mean, if even communicated at all. Complete lack of integrity, honesty and transparency. CEO LEADERSHIP: Rare communication. Communications are boarderline rude and ungrateful, resounding more of a beating drum. ORGANISATION STRUCTURE: No logic or structure to aid you in finding anybody or information. Even being in the old boys club won't help you - partly due to the level of growth, but also due to the level of staff turnover, in itself creating a moving goalpost, making even the simplest tasks long winded and unecessarily complicated. ACCESIBILITY OF INFORMATION: Mulitple systems and databases. None communicating with the others. Convaluted and complicated. OWNER, CEO & HR: Archaic attitudes. Blatant refusal to listen to staff or recognise the widespread demoralising and disengaging environment which their attitude and actions have created. Just plain ignorant and short sighted. Example: Its the beginning of Dec 2021. People are tired. Need a break. Infections are rising quickly. Lockdown seems imminent. PM communicates the need to WFH where possible. Many remember Xmas of 2020 and the last minute lockdown. Dysons communication: You must still come in to the office.

Cons: James Dyson's mandated working from the office five days a week is backward and it is clear he holds this view because he does not trust his UK workforce. He still thinks the world should work in the same way as when he was growing Dyson in the 90s and 00s The lack of flexible working is now not applied consistently across the business as software engineers can work from a couple of days a week. The leadership within the ExCo are terrible at empathetic communication. They are caught in limbo as don't run the business beyond sales, systems and ops.

8204,8204,,Dyson,10/5/2022,Highly unstructured and poorly operated organisation,1.0,"Pros: Decent pay compensation for an individual straight out of university. You get to use most of the amazing Dyson products first hand. The yearly employee discount (can be claimed thrice every year) and Amazon gift vouchers during major Indian festivals is a bonus. You will most definitely understand HOW TO NOT run an organisation or work with your team as a team-lead. If you are smart enough and have good sales acumen, you can hit sales quotas with not much effort and earn your incentives - this can be done by studying patterns and finding loopholes in the organization's practices and processes (It worked out well for me). Decent brand and image value on the resume.. Cons: TL;DR - This is NOT a great place to work. Toxic. Unprofessional. Mismanaged. The cons are definitely more than the pros. Please read all points mentioned. This being my first professional stint, I cannot compare it with any other organization, but from a general employee standpoint - there is no organisation with with such vast global presence and brand value so POORLY MISMANAGED. There is absolutely NO CLEAR COMMUNICATION between cross-functional teams which causes vital information to fall between the cracks. General operations, teams and organisational processes are SILOED leading to POOR EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE. Being a part of the sales team, there is NOT an iota of MOTIVATION or sales coaching/mentoring that is carried out to keep us productive. We worked as mere 'slaves', if I may say so. To earn incentives are the sole motivation used by managers. THERE IS NO GROWTH as there is definitely no space in the hierarchy unless the Leadership Team attempts to make room and let budding professionals grow to become leaders too. Managers adopt EXTREME MICRO-MANAGERIAL methodologies which causes extremely TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENTS. the majority of them have MBAs and experience from FMCG/Banking/Insurance and they run the teams like a tea stall and expect sales associates to sell Dyson products like mere biscuits. The 6-Day work week can be EXTREMELY TAXING for freshers and may take a toll on one's MENTAL HEALTH if no care is taken. Working on weekend's is fine to an extent. Monday's were the weekly off period. What's worse is getting calls/emails/messages and managers expecting us to reply and make sales if possible during this one cool-off period we are entitled. Most definitely UNPRODUCTIVE. Recognition and performance is lauded to the absolute minimum level possible and not something to write home about. Monthly quotas/targets are excessive and NOT REALISTIC. The incentives/bonus is NOT GREAT, very MEAGRE when compared to revenue generated as a sales function and the effort we put in. They definitely do need to work on rewarding better. Supply chain function is TERRIBLE, it hinders sales activities and orders in the pipeline. Moreover, most of the products at a given point in time are out of stock and not saleable due to supply not meeting demand. The overall work profile is monotonous and nothing new even in sales methodologies, there is not much involvement with the senior mangers/'so called mentors'. Exiting/Resigning from Dyson and concluding my professional services is by far the WORST EXPERIENCE one can go through. They are headstrong on completing the 60-90 days (60 in my case) of notice period. There is NO CONCEPT of buyout for early exit. They make it a point to keep the notice period as long as possible. Compensation as salary, incentives or other pending bonuses/settlements were NOT PAID on a timely basis during/within the period. The 60-Day notice period seems to only apply to the employee and not the employer. A very UNPROEFESSIONAL and DISHEARTENING exit process, nonetheless.",Sales Associate,,reviews,subjective,negative,

Prior to the Pandemic, there were plenty of opportunities to travel. The offices (especially the Malmesbury campus) are an exciting place to be.. Cons: All of the pro’s listed above however are negated by a toxic work environment. The removal of autonomy, the clear and unapologetic stance on flexibility and lack thereof, the erosion of trust (truly disappointing post a record year in 2020) have made for the perfect storm of attrition and sickness. The latter being particularly alarming, people of all levels, length of service, gender, differing departments and locations are being signed off daily for burnout, anxiety and a whole myriad of mental and physical health issues that is not being recognised or addressed. The working pace has always been fast but the current situation with a rapidly dwindling workforce means that those left have a unrealistic and unmanageable workload. When management challenge productivity and results and you respond that there isn’t anyone left in the business to deliver, you are told to ‘make it happen’. They simply don’t care that they are breaking people as long as products continue to be sold.

Cons: I was with Dyson for just under 2 years… and I count these months as the most miserable of my life. Dyson’s toxic, ultra corporate work environment managed to suck most of my self esteem and confidence in my own abilities despite having several years of experience compared to many of my colleagues in similar roles. There is a culture of promoting people who know how to talk the Dyson talk and be seen by the right people, which is true of most workplaces, but even more so at Dyson. Not that I even wanted a promotion for myself - I just wanted to get the hell outta there after the first 6 months!! But really the worst was the treatment of staff during and coming out of the pandemic restrictions. It’s been widely covered here already but it was truly immoral. I felt sorry for the senior management being made to tow the line in enforcing the draconian anti-WFH rules that were surely the work of no one other than James Dyson himself. Enforcing 5 days in the office while covid was still running riot in the general population put all Dyson people and our families at risk. Now it seems Dyson are arranging fake positive reviews on Glassdoor and I can’t say I’m surprised.

James and Roland are old fashioned managers who know nothing about modern leadership or how to motivate and inspire people. The rest of the leadership are too afraid to speak up, just telling James what he wants to hear. They're so dillusional that they think their competitors are writing these reviews to try to cause harm to the business.

However it feels as though the company is (finally) turning a corner. The new Chief people officer has made decent strides since joining and employee perks have a genuine positive impact on my life (gym, free lunches mean less prep outside of work and the food is brilliant especially the salad bar, hair dressers, sports massage etc all save me time).

It's a very toxic environment to work in. My line manager used micro managing as a tool to manage me. If you do the slightest thing wrong, whether your fault or not, then colleagues inform your line manager so you get reprimanded for it. While I was working there I did experience a low level of bullying. There is a massive lack of trust from management so they do not allow any flexible working or hybrid working. The company acted extremely poorly during covid, we had to come into the office during the lockdown because they were worried about their information being stolen, but were happy to put us at risk. This was also over Christmas, where loads of people in the office were getting sick with covid, we still had to come in 5x a week and risk getting sick ourselves and potentially ruining our Christmas. A friend of mine tested positive for covid so I tired to leave the office to get a PCR test and work from home for the rest of the day, but my line manager told me not to get a PCR test but to stay in the office and do a lateral flow. The following day I had symptoms of covid and tested positive. The company could have suggested we work from home the 2 weeks leading up to Christmas to ensure we were safe and to ensure we could visit vulnerable family members of Christmas. But they only care about their products and not their employees. The whole time I worked at Dyson we were required to wear masks all day while sitting at our desks (8.30-4.30). If you were seen without your mask on then they have 'mask police', who would go around asking you to put your mask back on and they would take a note of your name. Work starts at 8am, or 8.30 until 4.30 with the only break allowed being a 30min lunch. If you raised any concerns or complained about the bad working conditions then you were shut down and told that this was the 'dyson way' and if you didn't like it then you should leave.

8267,8267,,Dyson,6/1/2022,How to lose your workforce in 2 years,1.0,"Pros: I am genuinely saddened to witness the decline in this company over the last 2 years. It has gone from a place of excitement and inspiration to a place that seems to sap joy from you as soon as you walk in the door. My team and manager were the only pros but unfortunately they have also left or are leaving.. Cons: Unfortunately as you will see from other reviews, the real start of this decline came from Dyson's reaction to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, workers were able to have agreements with their managers that allowed them to work flexibly. This unofficial working from home took place globally and dyson went from strength to strength, however James Dyson appears to not have known this was going on. Apparently he believes that you can only be effectively working if you are sat at your desk 5 days a week because in an office there is 'collaboration'. Anyone not in the office is then threatened with disciplinaries. This shows a great lack of understanding of the world we currently live in and how teams work effectively. The majority of teams at Dyson work in multiple countries, communicating effectively on Microsoft Teams with people they have never met in person. Please explain how being in a Dyson office 5 days a week would aid with this communication. If they asked (which they haven't), they would likely find that most people do want to spend some, most or all of their week in a office location but everyone would like to be valued and trusted enough to make those choices with the support of their managers. Employees are not necessarily asking for anything new with regards to flexible working, they are asking to go back to how it was pre-pandemic. The decisions over the past 2 years are really starting to show. Over half of the team I work with have either left in the last month, are serving their notice or are off sick due to stress. This is not just down to lack of flexible working but also the general disrespect Dyson shows to employees. External recruiters are well aware what is going on at Dyson and are using it as an excellent opportunity to steal talent. On the flip side, recruiting into Dyson is almost impossible. Surely Roland and James have been made aware of this? The CPO Laura says she wants to listen but listening sessions with People team are cancelled/rearranged multiple times and listening only works if you actually act upon the information you are given. There is also a lack of respect for her own team - making decisions without consulting SMEs shows lack of trust and understanding.

The culture is the worst I’ve ever experienced and it’s only now that I have courage to write this review to make people aware of how toxic the place is- and therefore how damaging it can be to you- mentally.

Company has no structure, no process, like trying to fix a broken car every day, impossible. Company likes to talk about visions and ways of working, but just talks about the same over and over and never put into practice. Leadership is pure evil, no kindness at all. Treat people like kids and like they own us. Management is clueless. No learning, guidance at all from them. google is your mentor. You are bullied. They force you to come to the office, specially in days leadership is there. Leadership wont like you if they dont smell you at the office everyday, your job will mean nothing. HR is non exhistent. Once you resign, you are more bullied and treated with total disrespect, unprofessional. High turnover. You get sick, they bully you even more.

8276,8276,,Dyson,2/1/2022,Last year was bad and its only getting worse!,1.0,"Pros: - Free food and coffee was introduced in September 2021. It was a pre cursor to the mandatory on site attendance (see below) and whilst the food is pretty sub standard...most it is free - Loads of car parking space for those that drive. If you dont, there is a coach from Bristol or Swindon that leaves as the sun rises - Helipad at the back if you own a helicopter too - The engineers working on new products are smart girls and guys and it can be a great experience to see a product from inception to delivery. Cons: - Dyson is falling apart from the top downwards. The decisions/statements from James regarding flexibility for employees is well documented. Roland as CEO has been an awful appointment. Zero personal skills or charisma and speaks like he has little to no care for employees. Outside of having an exceptionally white shirt all the time, he has nothing impressive or inspiring about him. - No strategy just relying on the good old Dyson name. Those in the know are aware of new product delays, issues with logistics and increasing competition. Things that most employees cant control but are blamed regardless - Leadership is layered with people who have been at Dyson for 10+ years and literally following a set type. White, middle aged men who often believe their job title because it has 'Director' in it they know everything and wont mind bullying and suppressing people along the way. Unless you are a graduate... - Graduates are seen are the saviour to everything despite coming into Dyson with minimal experience. Flocks of experienced employees are leaving, arent being replaced and Grads are promoted into levels they cant manage, have no experience and only know the 'Dyson way'. Which for the record isnt a good 'way' to follow. - Zero flexibility despite what Dyson will say. All of the return to campus stuff has been documented but working from home does not exist here - Employees are quite literally leaving in their hundreds. The main catalyst has been the lack of flexibility and the forced attendance on campus. What Dyson ignore/forget/dont realise or appreciate is many people had pre-existing arrangements to flexibility when they joined Dyson, pre-COVID. These were removed which has added so much disruption to peoples lives at a time when we are going through a global pandemic. The decisioning and communications from HR and Leadership have been unforgivably bad - HR is getting strangled by management/James over employee retention, flexibility and are being forced to quite literally monitor people who do or do not swipe their access badges on site. I cant really blame HR as they are following orders, but the impact on employee morale due to this has been crushing - Huge blame culture across some teams. And those teams are often led by the aforementioned Director level types who only really know how to survive and stand on others at Dyson to get promoted to lead a team - Too much focus on shiny stuff and forgetting the important things that will drive Dyon forward. Communications from James have been limited to him talking about his new book (employees had the option to buy that for slightly more than you could on a big ecommerce retailer). Website is buggy, terrible to buy from but James announces a new virtual reality experience to save the day...which it wont of course as the number of people who use VR is only marginally more than those that use the helipad at Dyson.

They'll give you a free panini on your half an hour lunch.. Cons: The lack of flexibility is well known, but it really is crazy. The company don't believe working from home is working at all. Obsessive, incredibly untrusting, and laughing in the face of the pandemic. During my time here, this inflexibility has brought on much worry that I'd get in trouble for asking for days working from home that weren't ""valid"". I am not somebody who has ever really experienced anxiety before, so that fact alone should tell you how it makes staff feel. The lack of compassion is crazy. Need a bit of time at home to look after an ill family member? Don't be ridiculous. You'll get a day, maximum 2, and be ready to fight for that. The company simply do not care for you or your mental health. At all. Who can be happy, working for a company, knowing that the company do not care about your family? ""If you can work you must be in the office, at your desk, regardless of anything else going on"". It's a militant, oppressive position, which is making people leave by their hundreds. Its a problem which seems to be getting worse, rather than better. They're making it harder and harder to work from flexibly, which makes it harder and harder to motivate yourself to crawl into the office. Still, _some_ are allowed to work from home right now, due to the new government guidance! How nice is that? ... they will be back in too early, at the earliest opportunity, putting themselves at risk for absolutely no reason. Secondly, the Covid policies are remarkably contradictory. Staff are made to wear masks all of the time, including at the very spaced out desks. Marshalls storm around and demand you keep them on at all times. If you're made to wear masks all of the time because the air around your desk is unsafe, it doesn't sound safe enough to be in at all to me. Wearing masks permanently is very very cautious, but that is where the caution ends. Staff are forced in regardless of anything else going on, with no testing (there's nothing at all stopping infected people coming into the office), there's very little social distancing when you're not at your desk - The crushes at lunchtime are especially dangerous. Thirdly, the company have actively taken away opportunities to hear feedback from its staff, such as removing the pulse survey. Any company which chooses to close its eyes and cover up its ears from its existing staff should be a major red flag. I know why they don't want to hear it, but actively avoiding the feedback is a really bad (and dangerous) thing. Lastly, due to reasons I've listed above (and more) the the mood and the morale of the place, and therefore the culture of the place is absolutely horrendous. As described above, it causes tremendous worry and stress, and hearing stories about how the company has treated others in worse situations than me does not leave me with any reasons to feel excited or passionate about this company. People are leaving (or have left) in their masses, it amazes me that alarms aren't going off because the company is haemorrhaging staff. Long term members of staff, and new ones too. Maybe it's redundancy by exodus? There are companies doing great things right now, valuing and treating their people well. This is not one of them.

It might be another classy announcement to get back into the office again or your sacked. Sent of Friday night after hours! Or maybe we’ve just made some of you team redundant surprise! Oh and btw we still want to double dyson so if you can make up the slack that would be grand. Or there is flexible working dears but if you actually use it we will hunt you down and demand to know why you weren’t on site even though we told you you could. Or the latest don’t to what the government tell you, we know best, stay working at your desks we are watching. The way employees are treated is quite historic, you will be a number here. You will be paid below the industry average because you are working for the great dyson and you should be thankful that we let you in the gate. I’m not sure if we actually have any great products in the pipeline, most are just paint jobs or reactionary, not the great inventions that they once were producing. It’s all about producing something in such short time scales that everyone on the project goes out with stress. If I were betting I would wager that the talent that has left has struck a possible mortal blow. There does seem to be very little pre thought to some of the decisions so you will learn to be dynamic with the truth when asked. The last belter, don’t spend anything until next year. That stopped most of dyson RDD for 2 days until someone saw sense. It’s like someone left Roland in the pub on Friday night with his phone and told him don’t txt the company. It’s all quite sad as this once great company circles the drain, hopefully it’s not allowed to sink but my advice, don’t join, but watch as it might get back to being great again.

Cons: Basically feels like a car crash where every day you see more damage and realise how bad it is, with no plan to fix it: - Board unable to make decisions and just say yes to James and Roland - No direction of where Dyson needs to be in 3-5 years and how they going to get there - A lot (can repeat a lot) of outsourcing to multiple companies across a number of departments (HR, IT, Finance ....). No internal knowledge and capability. Lots of 3rd party staff working at Dyson, who do not care about the company and just follow a simple process as their contracts dictate. - Make operating model changes every 18 months but never actually land the new ways of work or the new structure and just causes more ambiguity, less accountability and makes it more difficult to move an inch forward - A revolving door of people leaving across all departments. And since they have draconian HR policies the roles are not being filled. This leaves those individuals who are still in the company covering for 2 if not 3 people as the board and leadership teams all expect the same amount of work and output no matter how few people are left. (Looking for 120% outcomes with only 30% of the staff to deliver it - recipe for disaster) If you are able to close your eyes and ears to the politics, happy to just look down and deliver your own work and not care about the overall objectives, like being moaned at every day for not doing 3 peoples jobs, want to be in the office 5 days a week and enjoy having limited support by your manager - then join Dyson.

Some employees accrued several weeks worth of ""time in lieu"" only to be told by the business they could have 3 days off as a thank you from the business.

8323,8323,,Dyson,24/11/2021,Not the company it once was.....,1.0,"Pros: Dyson recently introduced a whole range of new benefits to UK employees recently, including free lunches/drinks/fruit, plus things like on-site GP, hair dresser, EV salary sacrifice scheme, but these are viewed as little more than bribes to soften the blow of making it mandatory to be in the office 5 days a week. Unfortunately the fruit rations run out by 10am, the meal queues are huge, and the quality and size of portions has declined dramatically since being introduced. Many of us would rather pay a few quid to get a decent choice!. Cons: None of the above however can make up for some of the shocking HR policies implemented by the business in the last 18 months, which have served to create an incredibly negative atmosphere amongst the staff that are still here, and driven away the many fortunate souls that have sought alternative employment recently (or simply quit without jobs to go to or retired early!). The worst example of this for me was when the Exec team (or more likely JD) decided to force all staff back into the office during the first lockdown, despite the government clearly stating that anyone that could work from home must do so. We all received an email late on a Friday night telling us we had to return to the office on Monday, however this was followed by another email on he Saturday saying that this was no longer the case - basically due to a staff revolt! That was definitive proof that JD valued the success of his business over the health of his employees and their families. That was the moment that I decided I no longer shared the values of the company had spent years working for and contributing to. Since then, things have got progressively worse - staff satisfaction surveys have been abandoned so there is no way for employees to express their views anonymously (except via Glassdoor!); 5 day attendance on campus is now compulsory, with all staff monitored by HR for attendance. Morale is also further impacted by the unrealistic targets that the business now is tasked with achieving over the coming years due to the 'Double Dyson' strategy, which basically means doubling profits, doubling the amount of new projects, whilst at the same time halving the development time and cutting costs. With so many experienced and knowledgeable people leaving (or have left), this makes this even harder to realise. Dyson has always been a fast paced and dynamic place to work, but this new strategy seems doomed t failure. Unfortunately all this can be traced back to the very person that made Dyson such a success in the first place. All decisions on HR policy and working decisions seem to lead back to his door, with both CEO and CPO either unwilling or unable to influence him. The working conditions are completely out of step with modern practices, and it is clear from what internal recruiters are saying that this is having a serious impact of being able to both retain and recruit staff. And I haven't even mentioned yet the fact that it has been many years since we actually launched an innovative and successful new product! The failed Electric Vehicle project burnt through half a billion pounds before being scrapped, and as a reward for leading this terminated project, JD installed Roland as head of the entire company!

The people remain great but most are, quite sensibly, leaving en-masse.. Cons: Where to start... I wouldn't be able to fit this all in one review. However here are some of the most recent items to give you a flavour. They are generally focused on the great work of the 'back to work' functions. In the UK, they have established 'punching in', such as would be found in a car factory of the 60s. The owner is genuinely worried that people are taking advantage of him, that they have aggressively been making people come back into the office (#campusculture), even when there are multiple COVID cases reported each day. The 'Return-to-work' scheme therefore was rolled out like the annual 'back-to-school' campaign at ASDA, without any of the jolliness. Workday absence status is matched to your security pass being used on the door. Everyday the people function have to manually go and chase those who haven't clocked in to see what they are up to. If you still don't have a valid reason (there aren't many these days) then you are put on a naughty list which is sent to the CEO and owner. Work from home/flexible working is NOT allowed. If you need to not go to the office one day you need to log it in the system. Car breaks down, kids are sick, doctors.... Dyson have to know what you are doing. It reminds me of being at school again! To top it off there are also monitors who patrol the office and cafe asking if you are vaccinated and that you need to wear your mask at all times. In Singapore, teams are again made to go in despite a government mandate stating work from home is the norm. Instead they have to submit a covid test every sunday before the week of productivity ahead. Those who want to leave the country are actively and aggressively discouraged through threats of losing their job or having to take unpaid leave. COVID updates on this are sent in a very militant manner. Although travel is perfectly legal now from Singapore, albeit with caveats and process, people function are asserting their power with no regard for peoples personal situation. If you need to do a work from quarantine, this is not allowed (who knows why when we have been working remotely for a year)... To travel you are forced to sign a document which states the right to terminate you and not be paid if there are any changes to your plan. Then a member of the executive committee have to approve it to 'grant' you the permission to leave. As an aside, the culture has been all but crushed in the company. There is no spirit, no leadership and a lack of direction on the most part. Moral is through the floor and at the same time we are being told we need to double the profit in 4 years. However, no one knows how we are going to do it. I could go on, but that's enough for now.",Engineer,"Bristol, England",reviews,subjective,negative,

8394,8394,,Dyson,30/9/2021,Toxicity on steroids,1.0,"Pros: The lunches help you lose weight- great for portion control. Cons: Plenty of reviews mention the lack of flexibility and mandatory campus attendance. This is a policy that is out of step with the direction of most companies, and does put us at a disadvantage when recruiting for office based roles when competing with more enlightened companies. But, the implementation of this is a beautiful example of why employees, junior or senior, have fallen out of love with the company quite so spectacularly. It illustrates everything that is wrong with the current culture. So, as I see it, this is what happened. The new CPO and her team do loads of work gathering evidence of the benefits of flexible working during spring and early summer. This is vetoed by James Dyson as he has dogmatic views on flexible working that will not change. The executive have to come up with a coherent vision as to why we are flying in the face of society and come up with the concept of “campus” and just repeat that we are a campus organisation if challenged. On the plus side they come up with stuff to take the edge off- the free coffee, lunch etc. They present a policy on flexibility to suggest it is possible- you just have to go though a formal process to agree it. If permanent, an approval process where you present your reasons, if ad hoc manager approval. The permanent requests are exposed to be a way of avoiding people making formal flexible working requests (governed by a legal framework) when the majority of these requests are rejected. We are told that this process will start in September, to be logged in workday, dressed up in H&S- it’s good to know where you are in event of a fire- grounds. This is suddenly bought forward to August, with managers and HR having to go though attendance lists in the past to justify where people were in July (before “campus” attendance was mandatory). Workday goes live in September with some unexpected twists. Firstly, as part of the flexible working menus, you have to put in what category it is ie. domestic admin, medical reasons etc. There is also a comments section. We are then told to ensure that the comments section is filled in for tighter monitoring. Every week we get contacted by HR asking for more details. Also asked for reports. Now we get threatening emails for when we are managers have approved “too much” ad hoc flexibility threatening disciplinary action for both manager and employee.

Cons: What has happened since I started working with this company? When I started, the culture was all about doing the right thing, autonomy, trust and always pushing to innovate and try something new. Experiment. Then Roland became CEO. Oh my god. I’m not going to go on about the ludicrous inability to work flexibly, the simple fact is that JD has employed a “yes man” and he in turn has employed an Exec Board of “yes people”. In turn, some managers have become “yes people”. If you work for one of those (as I do) then you can genuinely expect to cry or break down. I’m on anti depressants. My manager hasn’t ever said “well done” or “thank you”. Ever. This despite the fact that I probably work longer hours than anyone else in my team, and have a proven track record. Nothing is ever good enough. And don’t - ever - make a decision which you think will be for the benefit of the company, because one day (in my case 4 years down the line) you will be chastised by not only JD and Roland but your manager and also theirs. Everyone is just too scared to back their man. Real shame. People are leaving the business in droves. The threat to the company isn’t the competition innovating quicker than us, it’s the business driving out every last piece of talent in an attempt to please JD.

Slow to adapt to anything internally now. Drowning in bureaucracy through growth. Inefficiencies - huge teams (particularly tech) delivering very little for their size. As a manager promoting really good people is made very difficult. If you do take a job here, negotiate hard on the way in as getting a payrise is notoriously difficult. Good, experienced people leaving all over the place. One of the worst things I noticed before I left was the CEO, in small group meetings (PR nonsense) saying that there was no evidence that recruitment and retention was affected by the ‘no working from home’ directive. I left almost solely for this reason and wasn’t given an exit interview. None of my peers were. Staff were never consulted about how they wanted to work post pandemic. If you don’t ask these questions you don’t get the answers you don’t want, right? Bottom line is you won’t feel valued if you work here.

Roland rules with an iron fist, a dictatorship where he micro manages every decision without debate. Want to book a flight - ceo sign off. Want to hire someone in a critical role that’s left - ceo sign off. Collaboration turned to fear. Roland has quite impressively destroyed an open collaborative progressive culture and turned into a culture of fear. He bullies everyone and everything in his path, he won’t listen, he won’t admit when he’s wrong and he doesn’t care about anyone’s opinion other than his or James. Talent replaced by puppets. He squeezes out the senior talent as they challenge him and disagree and replaces them with inexperienced puppets and yes men. It’s an insult to the talent that’s here and means that there’s no leadership examples to look up to. The brain drain has long started and the talent has left or is leaving, even the external recruiters know how dreadful it is and how many people want to leave. Complete lack of empowerment.

There is no listening or team work, decisions are made by JD & the CEO and no one else is welcome to have any input. - Peoples health and wellbeing are not a priority as shown by the Exec team forcing employees back into the office in May 2020 during a global pandemic against all government advice and guidelines. This only stopped when the government changed the law and they realised they could be in trouble. They now claim to be against doing this, yet we are tracked by team registers and door sign ins and called if we are not on site for x days per week. This increases whenever JD is in the UK. - They claim to offer flexible working when you interview however in reality this means you can start at either 8 or 9am. Working from home is not an option and if ever you are able to, you will be monitored and micromanaged heavily. - Progression and promotions are very hit and miss. In some teams it is handled well, in the majority, progression is based on time served not output and every senior job is awarded to friends of the hiring manager and rarely even opened up for applications. - Redundancies are frequent and becoming more and more brutal, realistically no one is surprised at redundancies anymore and a lot still speculate when we will eventually be moved to Singapore.",Commercial Manager,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: Culture: A lack of humanity and care for employees; the new C-suite and senior leadership teams don't prioritize people and lack integrity. The culture was once an open and a safe space, now, it leads with fear and no sense of leadership. If you try to look for the company's values, even on the career's site they don't list people as a top value. When they say 'people champions' it's in relation to consumers, not employees. Bullying/Toxic workplace: I have personally experienced bullying, retaliation for providing feedback and have had sr leadership share gossip/awful insults about employees' physical appearances. Discrimination and Racism: It's ironic that in the US organization, there are quite a few female leaders, yet they are not supportive of other women beneath them. Comments around roles, promotions, and anxiety of specific women getting pregnant and going on maternity leave. The poor handling of social issues internally and externally, someone actually said 'but you're not black' in response to my emotional outrage. You'll never feel less valued than here at Dyson.

Cons: Where to start... Its been quite a tragic journey for Dyson over the last few years, its really lost its way. It no longer cares about the individual (you or I), or the customer. It simply cares about making more money, and if that means sacking people in the middle of a global pandemic, then so be it! A lot of people on here point to Robot Roland (our CEO), which I don't think is particularly fair. This all stems from James Dyson. As he's got older and richer he's become more and more disengaged from the company. He's got much greedier, arrogant and bitter, (you know what they say, as you get older your worst traits come out stronger). Back to Robot Roland, think of him as an empty suit. He takes his orders in the Boardroom and duly issues them out, even if they are beyond what's legally allowed (like forcing staff back into the office during a national lockdown). What our CEO and Founder have failed to realise is that we are not robots, we are not here just to make a bitter old man richer. So we have started to push back on the nonsense, which they don't like, so they're now doing round after round of redundancies (even after promising there won't be more).

8686,8686,,Dyson,23/12/2020,An absolute shambles.,1.0,"Pros: Getting made redundant and the subsequent compensation package.. Cons: I honestly don't know where to start... It's quite simply the worst place I have ever had the misfortune to work. I am genuinely over the moon to no longer work here. The fact they paid me to leave (along with 900 others “because of Covid-19”) has been an absolute blessing. From the very first day you realise that the place is nothing more than a shambles. No organisation, headless chickens everywhere, communication (especially across teams/departments) is non-existent. You will essentially be firefighting from day one until the day you leave. Dyson like to point out that ""it isn't for everyone"" and it's ""fast-paced"" and ""unconventional""... It's none of these things. It's merely marketing spiel to cover up for the sheer incompetence that awaits you. And that's what Dyson does best - It’s very good at marketing itself and blinds you with smoke and mirrors. Everything looks amazing from the outside, but its a very different story when you're on the inside. You will get the opportunity to work with some of the worst managers you’re ever likely to encounter. Not just in a professional capacity - there are some truly awful human beings here. There are people “running” departments/functions that are genuinely in way over their heads and the desperation is embarrassing. The company structure is incredibly top-heavy; there’s Seniors-for-this, Heads-of-that, Leads, Directors, Managers… The list goes on. Ultimately none of them are in charge or have any authority. There’s just a constant power struggle with a ‘he said, she said’ mentality, all whilst trying to get one over on each other. Because of this, collaboration is pretty much non-existent, teams always say there’s “no time” to help and trust has generally eroded to nothing. It genuinely feels like a group of separate companies competing against one another to get the upper hand. You will have to constantly revisit work that’s been “signed-off” because someone has crawled out of the woodwork at the eleventh hour and raised objections. It’s just another case of someone trying to justify their ridiculous role and subsequent exorbitant salary. That or the fact you’ve been briefed by yet another person thinking they know what they’re doing… Either way you will be forever frustrated. Oh, and don’t bother going to HR if you do have any issues - you will be seen as the problem. You will not meet a more inept group of HR “professionals”. I swear that department only exists because it's a legal business requirement. Like many functions in the company it merely pays lip-service to its roles and responsibilities. I’m not even going to get started on “Being Dyson” and the “Different, Authentic, Better” nonsense... That being said, there are some genuinely cracking people that work here (although it’s looking like a lot of them want out following this year). Unfortunately though, they are outnumbered by ‘yes-men’ and useless people that are hired by equally useless individuals (very much like a virus spreading, which is kind of ironic all things considered). In the end, I can liken the place to Springfield Nuclear Plant - If you’re a Smithers or Homer (who’s in charge of a department don’t forget) you’ll do absolutely fine here. All the while Mr. Burns just keeps on raking it in whilst the place burns. It really is a sad joke.

They will say you need to be in role at least 1.5 years before promotion/changing roles, however this isn’t the case, so its misleading and dishonest. Work-life balance is a myth in this place, and you are expected to work all hours with literally no preparation or acknowledgment for your efforts. Leadership (chaos) under new CEO Roland "" robot"" Krueger has shifted heavily towards cost saving and cares more about profit than wellbeing of staff. He has a personality of a rock and after making 900 staff redundant he spent literally 1 minute talking about it, and quickly switched back to their fantasy about competitors and sales targets. Forcing staff to campus during pandemic and during lockdown (you will disciplined if you refuse, engineers have complained to guardian about this!). Literally made staff sit in outdoor tents for lunch just so they can get staff on campus during pandemic, my colleagues’ hot breath was more effective than the heaters in that tent. Chaotic and reactive is understatement, literally everything is done off the back of something happening in the business, so its never planned for or proactive. For example, they told everyone to come back to site after 5pm (after 1st lockdown) on a Friday to start again on Monday, only to reverse the decision 24 hours later cus they are so out of touch with people’s life outside of work. They bang on about these three values which literally make no sense and senior management do not act these values so how can staff follow this, please someone tell me!!! Culture of blame and no accountability, managers would rather throw you under the bus to save their own back than stand up for you. Literally no focus on diversity, apart from 3rd party cleaning staff who are lovely and the Reaction to BLM was embarrassing, company did nothing apart from an email weeks after events. No head of diversity and inclusion in 2020!! Wouldn’t be surprised if this company hired a white, 50+ private educated man for this role… lol Literally no woman on the board, so its just a bunch of men making decisions, how do they expect change and alternative decisions and outcomes?! The most siloed business on planet earth, I get product confidentially, but the communication is non existent between business areas and departments. Dyson will bang on about “change”, “fast paced”, “not for everyone” and you need to “be dyson”. However, this just covers up the sheer incompetence of the business. The reason they ask about managing change at interview (atleast 5 times) is because they u turn more than boris johnson, and cant make a decision so you have to deal with it. It not about changing with the times and technology as you would expect. The induction is the best ive been to, they show you the science, investment, engineers, products, let you take apart a machine, but in reality this just covers up the bad side of the business and after one month I was like wow they really sold me a lie in that induction. Dyson invested in a multi-million pound HRIS system because there were no global processes or about 20 systems in use globally prior to 2020. However, the data was so poor and they provided no training the system is a complete mess after 1 year and managers don’t know what they doing or how to use it. They recently layed off 900 staff “due to covid, when in reality this was because the company hired for too much growth which doesn’t exist. Some staff even layed off twice in 2020 can you imagine the stress of this? However, despite the above some of the people are wonderful and they keep you going during the daily chaos. The engineers create some amazing products, however I expect many staff to leave this place after their actions in 2020. You need to have strong mental health to take a career at this place cus boy it will break you down day by day until you cannot take it anymore/ cant perform your job.

Broadly speaking, people care about making and delivering the best, whether it is product or improvements to the business, despite really challenging working conditions which have been mostly self inflicted by James and the CEO. I have always thought that Dyson has so much promise and could be a truly incredible place to work, sadly in my time here that promise has been slipping further and further away from becoming a reality. Years ago when people said to me ""oh Dyson, don't they just make Hoovers?"" I used to challenge them and say how we made really amazing products and technology. I don't correct them any more.. Cons: Dyson does not care about its employees. The way it has treated people has gone from badly over the last few years to immoral in the last year. Lack of diversity of background or gender, little diversity of thought or opinion which diminishes to none at the top. Toxic 'yes men' culture among senior management leading to deteriorating running of the business and ultimately poorer products at the end of the day. There is every chance that you could be a high performer, working hard for years and turn up to work tomorrow to be told you're being severed with no notice so that your work can be piled onto the rest of the team to save a pittance in cost. Internal communication within the business is appalling, falsehoods and censorship are rife, the company claims to want to be 'authentic' but employees are desperate for truth.

As a result, emails are relentless. - Heavy email culture: Huge amounts of email all through the day and night and there is no respite at the weekend. Quite normal for staff to get up at 6 am and do a few hrs work from home before their commute, then work from 8 am to 6 pm and then once home and dinner/children sorted log on for a few more hrs. It's the only way you can keep up with the international way of working. - Expenses are a joke: Expenses go unquestioned. People taking their friends out for dinner, cabs taken when people were blatantly on holiday, holidays are booked around business trips, IE book a couple of meetings in Chicago so I can fly out Business Class then take my holiday whilst I'm there. Ignorant of Gov Guidance during Covid: Insistent that desks were filled. Desks were arranged in a socially distanced fashion but that meant that it was expected that all of those desks were filled. - Raise a ticket: It is outsourced and EVERYTHING requires you to log onto an IT portal and raise a ticket to raise a job number and go in a queue to be answered by somebody in a few days. Calls are often closed unanswered - no sense of urgency. - Sloping shoulders: Too many fancy titles for rather junior roles - almost everybody is a Director of something or another meaning people are constantly delegating things around in circles. - Back-to-back meetings: Your working day is filled back to back with meetings meaning any actions that need delivering as a result of those meeting almost certainly need to be done in your own time.",Senior Executive Assistant,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: Where to start?! Forcing RDD teams in during lockdown 2 whether you can work from home effectively or not. Despite everyone’s hard work this year, they are now making it mandatory to put 10% of your workers in the needs improvement category. Sold as a positive - but workers put in that bracket will receive no bonus! Sure, they will really understand this. How are managers supposed to do this to their teams who have performed over and above despite Covid19 and the shambles around them. Taking registers to ensure we are all present, multiple times a day! The company has lost every single drop of its focus and care for its workforce. We are now numbers and boy are those numbers being reporting on to make sure we turn up for work in a pandemic against government guidelines. HR seem to be powerless to influence the big cheeses. Rumours of more redundancies and outsourcing despite business performing well and at last years levels. Referring to the workforce as “engineers and others”. My colleagues outside of RDD are really enjoying that label. Every day is chaos. Ever changing priorities and knee jerk decisions, more and more work being piled on but with a reducing headcount.

Roland has created a toxic environment. He has zero ability to motivate. You are monitored by cameras 24/7 . HR are tracking peoples access and sending threatening emails to manager as to why people are out the office even when those people have medical reasons or on leave. I was so proud to work here but now I cannot wait to leave. This is clearly Rolands plan. Get more people to quit and move the business to Asia. UK will be just the university and research within the next few years. This really is an unpleasant place to work.

This year it has sadly continued to alienate the remaining work force who were struggling to come to terms with the shocking redundancies which were announced late summer and to deal with their increasing workload as a result. Forcing employees to work in the office full time 48 hours into a national lock down, when they have successfully proven they can work effectively from home over the last 8 months, regardless of the fact there have been 13 confirmed covid cases on site in the last week, is the final straw.

The CEO said it was his mistake in a conference call to the research leader and he would learn and would follow government advice in the future... Guess what, the future is here and the CEO has said everyone in the office again against government advice, so many of my staff work in modelling/analysis, spend time reading academic papers, or all day on Skype calls with no need to be sitting in rows of desks 2 meters apart wearing masks not talking to each other.

You do learn quickly and if you are the right type of person you can progress quickly but you need to push this yourself you won't get any help.. Cons: Out spoken Brexiteer, first round of redundancies, ventilator PR story*, ultimatums to come back to the office during COVID, second round of redundancies. Senior management especially the CEO are totally disconnected from the values and personality of 'old' Dyson. Greed has set in. (*I truly respect the engineers and teams who put hard work into this but the way it was hyped up to the press was totally damaging overall and I believe against the government guidance for the initiative.) You used to be proud when someone asked where you worked, not anymore. It seems the PR team and leadership are so desperate to cover up past criticism they try and turn everything into a good PR story. It just ends up embarrassing and the brand has been severely damaged over the last few years. The new CEO is here for one reason, cut costs and increase profitability so one man can still have his dividend at the end of the year. There is a clear lack of regard and lack of skill around how to keep people motivated and inspired. People given 'high-performing' rating for 2019 performance had their bonus cut to standard at the very hint of a global crisis, and as always, most found out from their friends or rumors rather than official communication from the management. I understand this in another company but when its the UK's richest man saving a few million, it's a bit miffing. Then again, this is the same man who later ditched 900 'sales and repair' staff in the middle of a recession, blaming COVID . The way it was announced was just as calculated, a ten minute webcam briefing from the CEO explaining that although sales are good, we need to get rid of people. Turns out only around 50-60% of those were 'sales and repair', lots of project managers, engineers, heads of department, quality, HR etc. were swept under the rug. The latest embarrassment is the debacle surrounding 'return to work', first there was the u-turn, now there is daily reports where managers are asked daily on the percentage of staff they have back in the office. Functional leaders are spending there days chasing people into the office so that they don't get pulled up by the management.

There are some great job opportunities if the right people like you. I have some amazing colleagues who work so hard to get projects out faster and cheaper than ever.. Cons: Where to start? Used to be quite fun and exciting. Now slow, hierarchical and predictably disappointing in terms of people policy. - Absolute shambolic management of return to work. Asked us to come into work in May despite government advice still being to work from home. Email sent after hours on a Friday, to come back in on Monday. Officially they retracted it, but offline they still made us come in. This was 8 weeks before government advice changed. - Have misled the company and press about the redundancies, suggesting that retail was struggling due to COVID. Most of those made redundant aren't retail people. Loads of engineers were made redundant. They've used COVID as an excuse to thin the herd, cut costs and line James' pockets even more. Just be honest about it. - Robot Roland. Yet another Dyson CEO claiming that they are the one who truly does care about people. And then proceed to do the absolute opposite of caring for people. Monthly business updates delivered with no charisma or interest - the redundancy announcement was abysmal - delivered with absolutely zero empathy. I've never experienced such an uninspiring leader and don't feel good for the future of the company if this is the best we've got. I don't think he cares though. - There is a complete mismatch between the way Dyson portrays itself as an employer vs. how they actually are. They want to be taken seriously as a tech brand, but offer none of the forward thinking opportunities or ways of working that tech companies offer. As a result we can't recruit young or fresh talent, so we do the same things over and over again. It's been made clear that we are not a work from home company whilst lots of other companies right now have learned during COVID that they can trust their employees to work remotely, and that recognising this wins their employees' respect and loyalty. Dyson has none of that trust. We're told to make sure we take holidays and rest, but if you go on holiday and have to quarantine on the way back, you'll need to take that as unpaid leave. - Lack of diversity at leadership level is worse than ever. Middle aged white men jostling for power and calling all the shots with no interest in ideas or input from anyone else. And we wonder why we can't bring in a young consumer or make more innovative products.

Nice benefits on campus: free gym, cheap beautician/barber, cheap good food.. Cons: You think by joining Dyson you will grow fast, learn so much and be in touch with amazing and innovative technology. Not true. They will ask you to move quickly in the middle of England, leave everything behind. No way you can challenge them on the salary. Then you will most probably report to a line manager that knows less than you but will be a big buffer on your professional growth. Visibility is ESSENTIAL but still, all up to your line manager to decide on your path most probably based on how your skills will make him/her feel threatened by you.

One of my favorite aspects of the job has been helping Dyson owners better understand the technology, and being able to remind them of all the additional benefits of Dyson ownership: free tech support, and our Dyson service centers in some markets. Dyson owners are very vocal about how much they enjoy their products and often make a point to stop by and tell their Dyson stories and how their lives are improved.

When concerns are brought to management regarding the quality of the team's work, it feels as though management gets upset that these concerns are being brought up and that they have to spend extra time either training or discussing areas of improvement. I've basically been told to stay in my own lane after voicing my concerns; and this was within 2 months of me completing training. At this point, I have no desire to want to better the company or team as when I bring something up to the supervisors, they become disgruntled. In addition to this, our source of information is never updated. There is varying information/instructions going around constantly and neither the team leader's nor the sups seem to come up with the same answer; so most of the time, processes are done incorrectly by the agents.

An easy fix to the 50% turn-over? Our Global CIO has left the organization. Coincidence? I think not. He saw the fast-moving train to destruction. Our Vice President of Human Resources? Well she left too. Our Vice President of IT? Well she left too. Our Vice President of Legal? Oh, he found a new job. Countless Directors and people with 7+ years vested? Oh, they are gone. Again, Coincidence? I think not. I’m certain they were all privy to seeing the train to destruction. My point here is that many key people have left the organization on their own over the last year and it’s a completely different culture. Everyone is frustrated, burnt-out, or spending endless hours venting to their co-worker about how much they hate their job. Dyson will never admit the idea of outsourcing was a horrible one. Fake it till you make it, create more “redundancies” or “restructure” again when it all comes crashing to the ground? Outsourcing to India is not bad, it is ABHORRENT. Every time I get an India IT person assigned to help me with issues, I know it is doomed. They just suggest “fix” solutions instead of getting to the root of the issue. They keep dragging and delaying the issue hoping it will go away on its own. With the operations team, it’s worse. They will never voice out any problems until the magnitude becomes so huge that they can no longer sweep things under the carpet; then they expect YOU to solve it for them since they have no freaking idea what to do about it. Sloth, refusal to take ownership of problems, incapacity to think etc., the attitude problems are abundant. Hiring cheap labor workers to fill the gap of the so called “labor shortage”. This was an epic decision and the wrong one. “COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS” Allow me to destroy that statement. At face-value, the costs turn out much less. That fact is completely negated when it you realize how much time it takes Accenture to get ANYTHING done. Days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months. I had a team of 6 take 2 months to fix a simple error. I use “fix” lightly, because the issue was not solved it was disposed of. The time difference with the United States is the worst possible. They are disorganized and extremely difficult to motivate. “Yes” can have a different meaning. What once took 5 minutes now takes 5 days. They have a difficult time taking responsibility. They are very good at “excuses”. Accenture Excuse Example: My associate told me once on “Monday” that he will be sick on Friday. I asked: “Are you getting sick right now [on Monday]?” He said: “No.” I asked: “how do you know then you will get sick on Friday?” No response and then he said: “I have to go to a party on Friday.” I said, you just lost your trust in 30 seconds which you built in 6 months working with me. I asked him: “why did you lie to me?” He said: “this is the way things work in India with Indian managers.” When productivity is very low, making excuses for missing issues have very little effect or even no effect on the already low output. They make once happy people miserable. Time to be realistic Dyson. Reality always wins, and any argument made will not change that reality. Also, it is wise to keep jobs in your own country if you want to have future economic growth and a good work culture environment. What these white collared Execs in the land of Malmesbury fail to realize is how much extra work it is for us to try to coordinate efforts with people that do not have industry experience. We end up having to coach these offshore “managers” along and re-coach them and re-coach them (insert broken record). Most days, you end up feeling like a teacher with an incompetent student who will not listen or simply cannot comprehend the needs of the business. Do I think anything I wrote here will change the likely outcome of this company riding along on this train-wreck of an idea until it derails? No sir or madam. At the end of the day, Indian outsourcing is a 200-billion-dollar industry. Put that number into the perspective “cost savings”.",Business Partner,"Chicago, IL",reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: Senior leadership do not act on the feedback the employees give through staff surveys. Recent place of work contract change has been pushed through with no willingness to proactively address individual concerns.

8938,8938,,Dyson,16/1/2020,Just keeps going downhill,1.0,"Pros: The people. Fellow co-workers who have become lifelong friends. Although with turnover we are losing the good ones all the time. Casual dress code. Somewhat flexible on working remotely and not strict on arrival and departure times. Flex Friday’s. Barista bar in office.. Cons: The constant turn over of leadership and never following through on making things better. Pretending they are addressing employee concerns but never do Saying they value employee growth and career development but not actually doing anything about it and just letting people spin their wheels forever The new processes and systems that were introduced to make things easier on us have made things worse. Especially Accenture. There is no support. Accenture is the most worthless resource and one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever seen at a company. Accenture Procurement and especially IT are terrible. Leadership pretends to care about these problems and asks for your feedback, but when you try to bring up the issues and work on solving them, they actually dont do anything about it and tell you that you are not being a team player. Very hypocritical. Most people in the office are getting more and more miserable by the day and starting to take it out on each other so what was once a friendly work environment no longer is. Claim to promote work life balance but the people who never stop working are the ones who are rewarded and revered. We are controlled and micromanaged by UK office and execs. The UK execs consist entirely of old white men who could not care less about employee satisfaction and are introducing these new systems under the guise of improving processes when all it does is improve their bottom line. Then even with all of these cost cutting measures and constant spouting of “record-breaking” profits, we somehow never manage to make full bonus. They set the goals to impossible standards so that we can never get a full bonus. We moved into a brand new office space so that we would have more room but they chose a location that gave us no room to grow and after only being there a year we are already out of space and people don’t have desks. No one has assigned desks and they are first come first serve. Employees literally don’t have desks to work at.

8958,8958,,Dyson,27/10/2019,A technology company as great as their products!,5.0,"Pros: Dyson is such a great company! If you’re expecting to walk in the door of a very structured, corporate company, you are wrong. The dress code is smart casual and the company functions like any tech start-up. It is still a privately held company. It feels like a small company. There are not a lot of set processes. You don’t need to wait months to get a boards approval or sign off. The office is an agile, open floor plan. No one, regardless of title, has their own private, closed door office. Overall, the Chicago office is fairly small, about 300. I’ve had the opportunity to work with many teams not only in the US, but also Canada, Mexico, and even the UK. You really have the ability to see your work have a meaningful, global impact. I’ve also have had the opportunity to work on many side projects of things that interest me. If you raise your hand to volunteer on a project, most likely they will let you get involved in some way. The teams are also very collaborative and supportive. They truly live by the company mantra of “solve the problems others ignore”. If you’re stuck on something teammates and management are always willing to jump in to help. A team that works together succeeds together. Benefits package is good. There is a good work/ life balance. The products are truly amazing. I don’t know how I ever lived without an Air Purifier (it’s done wonders for my seasonal allergies) or an Airwrap (15 minutes to style and dry my hair, instead of 1.5 hours). Employee discount and employee special sales are always a nice perk. When a new product is released, communications does a really great job planning activities for the office and there will usually be a contest for a free product. Employees also have the opportunity to participate in new product trials. The company Christmas party is always so much fun too. It is a huge costume party. They determine a theme globally each year and there are prizes for the best dressed team.. Cons: This is not a con for me, but it can be for some. Dyson can be very ambiguous and fast paced. Dyson is still a fairly young company, especially in the Americas. Dyson has only been in Mexico since about 2016. There are not a lot of processes in place. Sometimes the information you need may not be available. No 2 days are the same. Things are constantly changing. If something is not working, we’re not going to continue to try doing things the same way. We will regroup and find a better way of doing things.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,negative,
8983,8983,,Dyson,13/10/2019,Snob culture with little respect,1.0,"Pros: A few decent managers and some proper decent engineers, bur far less than their should be. Most are just glorified salesman who have blagged their way up the ladder. Good coffee and a nice location in the countryside. I met some decent people here but most have now left.. Cons: Staff moral is at an all time low; the VP’s, Director’s and CEO constantly bang on about how much money the company is making & how amazing we (the staff) are, however they still don’t reward appropriately or appreciate the staff when it counts. If you don’t fit the Dyson mold of being privately educated, have the gift of the gab, and preferably partake in upper class extra curricular activities then you’ll struggle to get on, as only the favourites get promoted. You could work for years to improve Projects and delivery but get no appreciation. Obsession with rig building, reviewing things to death and Visuals overshadow the not so glamorous Engineering guts of the project. I believe the Upper management fundamentally don’t know how to run a company properly as most have never worked anywhere else. The place has out grown most of them. Many decisions are made on egos and personal gain, not for what’s best for the Business. Middle managers are obsessed with building their own empires and pushing themselves up the pecking order, rather than doing what’s best for the Business. Even if your manager fights your corner it will be likely be ignored and overruled by a Director. In summary a shiny pretty enticing shop front, but a rotten core to this Company, run by people that really don’t seem to care about the staff at all. If you’re privately educated and can give a good salesman pitch with all the jazz hands you’ll get on; if you’re a proper hard working Engineer who delivers good quality work and you are from a non-priviledged background then you will struggle to progress – Go and work for a proper Engineering company instead and actually be appreciated.",Engineer,,reviews,subjective,negative,

No one can do their job effectively because our technology is garbage and our laptops are horrendous. You spend more than a quarter of your day fixing an issue with your technology with some person oversees, which then turns into a month or more of back and forth emails only to not have the issue resolved and then having to wait until you are in the office to have the 1 person at the IT walk up bar bombarded with people and issues! That’s really smart Andy Gamble and Jim Rowan! You should both get the Being Dyson award! I guess as long as you’re saving $$$ while making $$$$$$$!

To put this into perspective - they are still trying to solve/develope knowledge on a problem that exists across multiple electronic/PCB projects for over 5 years which other ""technology companies"" would laugh at. I tried to tell them how my previous company dealt with this issue when I joined Dyson but I was branded as an idiot for speaking out.

Some departments have constant rollover so either it is REALLY bad management or they want Dyson on the resume. Employee perks are disappearing, they always find an excuse to not give full bonuses, and want employees to work 24/7.",Analyst,,reviews,subjective,negative,

Knowing that you work in the US HQ is a pretty awesome and gratifying feeling. Awesome accommodations for the office: shuttles, parking, in office barista, food delivery service.. Cons: On the other hand, disappointing culture where your superiors do not promote you or your growth. I’ve heard employees being in the same position for years without moving up in the ladder; apparently if you’re not in the UK office, in sales, or part of the business to business teams, you will not be getting promoted. The company expects you to learn their new systems, but will not expect you to grow in your position. Also have been witness and victim to in office bullying; apparently some people will manage you based on their tenure and title. Leaders in UK have promised to change and try to improve office culture and environment, but their words are hallow and only filled with smoke and mirrors.

9067,9067,,Dyson,25/3/2019,Do not look after talent,1.0,"Pros: Cafe. Interesting and varied work. Dyson is a great success story but -. Cons: Dyson have been paring back staff reward for years in order to control total staff cost. First they removed performance related pay rises and gave a higher bonus. Saving the company a fortune but hitting staff salary progression. Then they froze promotions. Saving the company a fortune but hitting staff salary progression. Then they decided that they had better look like they care about staff reward, so introduced a new performance conversation culture and made all the right noises about rewarding high performers and awarding smaller pay rises and bonus to underperforming staff. Sounds good. The trouble is, the process to decide who gets what is not based on objectively measured contribution, but on a few managers in a room ranking everyone in their team based on what they can remember them having done in the two weeks before that meeting (forget everything they have achieved in the last 12 months). Then, even if that list is somehow a relatively fair reflection of the high and low performers in the team, it then goes to HR for 'calibration', at this point if there was any objectivity it quickly gets steam rollered by the overriding strategy of the exec to reward as little as they can possibly get away with. The more you earn, the less likely you are to get a higher % payrise or bonus than the 'default' award (because that's more expensive for Dyson). Junior staff are most likely to get extra and that way Dyson can boast that they rewarded x000 staff for high performance... and still keep the cost to a minimum. They look like they care about staff reward and thus keep the staff sweet... Happy days!

Now you are better off buying at the retailer on special. Dyson looks great on your resume' it will open doors, get a 3 month contract and leave so you at least have their name on your resume'. My colleagues really lovely and I made a few lifelong friends there. The hours and work life balance have improved in the time I worked there with opportunities for paid overtime.. Cons: An extremely poorly run customer care centre. Team leaders are encouraged to belittle their staff, give negative feedback and treat them like kindergarten children. Do not expect praise or thanks for work done just negative feedback on what you have not done. Never will you get any real support or help, but the lip service is really great. Work for Dyson if you love being told what you are doing wrong all the time and get no credit for the work you do. They will work you into the ground and still tell you that you did not perform. Dyson has a no bullying policy but I have documented proof that they do bully and they do it in an insidious and very damaging way. The Customer Care Management is poorly organised, reactive and with extremely poor and antiquated management skills. There is a creepy way of making out they have the knowledge and skills to run the Customer Care. Management is great at talking but not walking the talk. Beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing personalities particularly in the upper management. Bullying by proxy and lying point blank to your face is common. Big egos that makes themselves and the company very ugly. In my time at Dyson I literally saw hundreds of people come and go. A revolving door that has not been resolved with new management or a new location. Dyson Customer Care have no documented procedures. Everything is done ""on the fly"". They put so called procedures in place and have no ability to follow through. Communication is about as bad as it can get. No opportunities to move forward in the business if you are skilled or proven to be able to do so. They are really good at giving these positions to the incompetent unproven staff members mostly. Possibly a power thing, it is the only reason I can think of. You are expected to be a yes person which is contrary to their lip service of saying ""come to us with your suggestions or ideas"".

Proper release management, retrospectives and recording technical debt just not on the radar for them. - I was on projects where we had to try and convince managers to use something like Jira rather than excel for project management. - Dyson are all about the branding and marketing and they are fantastic at it. This means that people aren't honest about how low-quality the work that gets done is. - It's the kind of the place that rewards people working 70 hour weeks rather than judging quality of work produced. - Don't work here if you enjoy having an impact on the business and like producing high-quality work.

Management are incredibly arrogant and see all employees as numbers not people, they are not true leaders and lack the ability to create a cohesive and engaging environment.

They have an incredibly high turnover which could be the result of; • Dramatically underpaying their employees • Overworking all teams consistently • Cutting staff discounts (employees now receive the same discount as customers) • Eliminating the annual cost of living wage increase • Hiring externally and not promoting from within • Inadequately planning for the future • Constantly implementing inefficient systems and processes • Poorly located office (there is no public transport or parking available, often employees receive fines or damage to their cars while parking near the office) It is a shame I had to give Dyson a 1 star rating to leave this review, if possible I would have given them no stars.",Anonymous Employee,Sydney,reviews,subjective,negative,
9159,9159,,Dyson,3/9/2018,Great place to work- innovative company &  good culture,5.0,"Pros: We all know that people are more likely to make an effort to share a bad review than a good one. I have read the last few reviews and I want to share my honest review of Dyson. Pros: Summing it up in a few sentences, Dyson employs intelligent, passionate and like-minded people. There has been management change recently which has only meant good things for the place. People are genuine and know how to have a good laugh. Your ideas and feedback is taken seriously and the company is always moving forward and so it keeps you on your toes. It’s products are great and the innovation is worked on by many people for a long time and so you actually believe in the product when selling it.. Cons: Not really a con but it’s a fast moving and competitive company in the industry and so if you’re not a person who likes to be challenged and or to challenge the status quo, then it might not be the place for you. And I will say, the staff discount needs to be higher!",Anonymous Employee,Sydney,reviews,subjective,positive,

9168,9168,,Dyson,5/9/2018,"Slick branding on the outside, dysfunctional & chaotic mess the inside.",1.0,"Pros: Reputation - people (like I did before joining) think this is a forward-thinking company. Perhaps their R&D is but that's it. It's all smoke and mirrors. If you enjoy coasting along under the noise without any purpose then you'll fit right in.. Cons: IT - What a complete mess. Blind leading the blind. I've worked in many large organisations and this was the most chaotic & dysfunctional place I've ever experienced. No purpose or direction and so many people I'm aware of didn't end up doing the job they were hired to do. I, like others, left a good job on the false premise of what the job they were hiring for only only to find out it we were essentially mislead. If you've got any words in your propective job title / description such as ""strategic"", ""design"", ""architecture"", ""analysis"" or ""planning"" then do yourslef a favour and ignore all those words. Everything it done on a knee-jerk reaction where I've never heard the term ""JFDI"" said so much. As nothing it written down, the ""I"" in JFDI (""it"") changes subjectively on a given day depending who you speak to. As mentioned, it's chaos and certain people not only thrive under that condition but benefit from it and they're in charge at the moment. Famously the current CEO said, ""I wouldn't sack my own children if they were falling behind, I'd help them grow..."" ...weeks later there were mass redundancies. Laughable (only as I wasn't affected) but just goes to show the left hand really doesn't know what the right hand is doing. So glad to be out of there now, my sincere advice (and why I'm taking the time to post this) is don't believe the hype. Look for the themes on the various reviews and you'll notice OVERWHELMINGLY the themes for the IT side of the organisation compared to say the product and R&D side. Don't confuse the two, they may as well be completely separate companies. IT is a bloated with a plethora of people with no purpose nor distinct role yet also key functions are majorily outsourced to vendors who hold significant hold to this small-minded IT organisation ran by small-minded people.",IT Design,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,negative,

You are definitely not wedded to a traditional career path here! - Great opportunities to live and work abroad - (on the whole) supportive management. There are a few bad ones (same with any company!), but they are becoming less and less common - I have taken maternity leave and returned to work and found the return to work well supported - New CEO is excellent. He communicates extremely well and is very approachable. Any CEO who queues in the same coffee line as the rest of us is approachable in my books! - CCO is inspiring-genuinely makes you think that we can all achieve anything and is constantly striving to take us forward- he has really transformed marketing in the last 5 years - Great technology, and it is at the heart of everything the company does - Exciting future with further expansion already underway - Beautiful campus, great work environments, cafes and site. It is an agile working environment, so you need to be comfortable with not having an assigned ""spot"" to sit in!. Cons: - If you're expecting every part of this company to be as glossy as the brand is to consumers, it's not. It's young, systems are still developing and sometimes it really has a startup feel to it sometimes. I love it, but the company is definitely adjusting to being a big company- it means there are plenty of opportunities! - This is being addressed, but it can be frustrating that there is a real divide between the people who go above and beyond and those who do the minimum. It was very refreshing that the CEO recognized this and acknowledge it almost straight away when he took the role - The company grew fast- so all focus is on the ""what"" you do, rather than the ""how"". However, that is changing and a new performance approach has just been launched - I cannot commend the company for diversity in the head office at the moment. From a gender diversity perspective, there are definitely teams that are still all male led at a leadership level. Some lack of diversity in the head office is likely to come from the area where the office is based, but I would love to see more commitment to addressing diversity - Job titles are messy and need aligning- the titles aren't always representative of the jobs people actually do which can be frustrating to navigate - Not the place for you if you can't cope with ambiguity or changing directions! - ""Official"" career development historically has focused on those in their twenties: with graduate and ""pioneer"" programs being implemented.

I think that if you are an engineer (non-software), this can be a good place to work, but Dyson is abysmal at anything software related.. Cons: IT is terrible - it took them 5 months to provide me with a server for a large data science project. And then they tried to take it away 3 weeks later. You also don't have admin access on your laptop, so if you need to install something like python, you'll have to wait weeks. Dyson is very much a windows-based company. If you want to use UNIX you really have to push and there will be little if any support. As far as I can tell, managers do not take their role seriously. My manager only did task management, no feedback or identification of training opportunities. I did not even receive probationary period feedback (just ""it's a pass""). There are no HR processes in place to ensure that managers take their role seriously, and there is very little recourse if your manager was not behaving appropriately (Mine was dismissive, constantly talked over me and ignored my opinions. I spoke to HR repeatedly over a period of 6 months, and they did nothing. My manager and HR's reactions were the main reason I chose to leave.) Dyson is the kind of place where, if you have a good manager it can be a great place to work, but if you don't then you're completely stuck and powerless.

9312,9312,,Dyson,1/7/2017,Dysons Taren Point call centre in Australia,1.0,"Pros: Good staff discounts are available.. Cons: During recruitment, Dyson was promoted to me as a multi-national, multi-billion dollar company seeking to transition into a global tech company. When you think of large multi billion dollar organisations in Australia, you think of companies like Apple, Facebook, Telstra, Commonwealth Bank. All these companies are on the cutting edge of various technologies. Dyson is not like any of these companies, firstly the facilities are poor and dated, something that you would expect out of the 90's. The contact center is a small office attached onto a warehouse where repairs are carried out. They are not a tech company, until very recently, they used a rostering system designed in an excel spreadsheet. During the first week, we were told that Dyson only hires the best and expects outstanding performance from all its employees, and here going above and beyond is the standard. Unfortunately, the pay is not in line with these expectations and they will pay you as close to the award wage as possible. Dyson claims to make superior products to their competitors, and they expect a premium price for the products. This philosophy definitely does not carry over to paying staff a decent wage. They offer pay far behind their multi-billion dollar competitors in Australia. If you have worked in a call centre before, you may be used to having weekly or monthly team meetings to learn about what is happening in the business, and get to know your team-mates and spend time with your team leader. This does not happen at Dyson, there are no meetings. Updates are communicated via email, you are expected to stay up to date on all emails, even though you are never provided any time to read your emails. There is a maximum 5 second gap between calls, and there will be at least 20 people waiting on hold all day, so there will never be a break. If you do not stay up to date on your emails you will be berated and criticised for it. Other people do it, so why can't you? The only way to read your emails and stay up to date is to cut corners and do things like place customers on hold, and then read your email. Management seem oblivious to admitting this, and so the cycle continues. You don't receive much opportunity to review and improve your work as a customer service representative, your Manager will send you call feedback via an excel spreadsheet with some ratings for your call, and an attached copy of the recording they rated. You are not provided any time to listen to the call, and the expectation is that you will do this in your breaks or forward it to your home to review later. The contact centre is desperately understaffed, yet also over budget and cannot increase the maximum headcount, this is despite the above 20% profit Dyson made last year which resulted in a wind fall of hundreds of millions of dollars, which the CEO wrote to the entire company to boast about. Morale is getting worse for staff, as management is clamping down on spending money to appease angry customers with broken parts, as every maximum dollar must be extracted from Dyson customers and retained, yet they can't find money to answer phone calls in a timely manner. Things got so dire before I left that in the last ""quarterly meeting"", a survey was sent around requesting for volunteers to hold the meeting during their lunch breaks, instead of the company needing to provide time to update its employees about the business. Staff who refused were berated by management and told how disappointing it was. Dyson has decided to begin to focus on internal sales, and are implementing sales KPIs into the call centre, as of the time of this review, you must sell 2 finished good products per day. Dyson does not pay any dollar based incentive scheme for these sales. I personally, have not heard of a company that did not offer an incentive scheme to people with sales-based KPIs. Dyson, in Australia at least, appears to be a company focussed on extracting as many dollars as possible from customers, whilst spending the bare, absolute minimum. As a call centre, it is a horrible, depressing work environment and I would advise anyone to avoid it, unless absolutely desperate. I cannot think of a single positive about the organisation, except that it offers good staff discounts and has a cult-like customer base.",Customer Service Representative,Sydney,reviews,subjective,negative,

9347,9347,,Dyson,15/2/2017,"Toxic culture, disregarding people",1.0,"Pros: - there are some great people on the teams (not enough) - employee discount at Christmas - sometimes there's some free stuff, like apples and chocolates.. Cons: This list is based on my experiences and conversations I had with colleagues. - the company is a mess, it seems they base their business decisions on a mixture of luck and ego. - or at least that's what you see because of the unbelievable lack of transparency: no strategy or direction is cascaded down the line. - C-level briefings are uninspired and non-inclusive: working for the company you'll only know as much as anybody reading the news. - diversity is not an aspect: higher management consists of middle-aged white men. No women or PoC as far as you can see. - promotions handed out based on time spent at company not on merit. This is seriously off-putting: how do you expect the good ones to stay if you don't appreciate performance. Oh and it's not an exception that bafflingly incompetent people get ahead. - no performance appraisal: it's really not worth to go above and beyond with your work, because no one will appreciate it; not your manager, not HR. It's simply not part of the culture to cherish exceptional performance. - ridiculous top-secret attitude leads to functional and knowledge silos not sharing which again causes disconnect between functional teams: duplicating efforts, and re-inventing the wheel. - no career development opportunities. No incentive from management or HR to help you grow. - do not in any case ask for help from HR or management: they'll scrutinize you and your request is only seen as a complaint. - and you cannot help your former colleagues moving on as you are prohibited from giving reference on performance. - the underdog culture should not mean that everyone has to carve out their way themselves - this is a ridiculous way to take no responsibility for employees careers. Top-down approach can and should be a part of a healthy company culture. - Management should be a role model in showing inclusiveness and integrity. Instead they lock themselves away in their ivory towers. You'll never see upper management mingling with the employees, having lunch or even a conversation with them. - middle-management is a joke: they are only preoccupied with their own career progression; no leadership skills whatsoever. - Dyson values are empty words: working for companies in the past that took culture seriously I was baffled how most employees and most work was not aligned to the alleged company values. But if you work there do not ever confront management or HR about this or you'll burn yourself. - corporate culture is vilified to the extent that processes and measurement are regarded as unnecessary bureaucracy; it is not - the company is growing at a fast pace but there is still no structured internal communication, no transparency, no onboarding process, no feedback and appraisal process - just individual efforts by a marginal layer. - old-school hierarchy: on the ""lower""-levels you have no impact on even the way you work. Keep your good ideas for a place that listens. - HR: I know you'll be reading this - and won't do anything, because let's be honest: you don't care. There's still a lot of people applying for positions so you don't even have to put minimal effort into talent retention. Not that you care; you get your salary at the end of the day anyways.",Anonymous Employee,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,negative,
9350,9350,,Dyson,11/2/2017,Worst management I have ever seen,1.0,"Pros: This company has a very positive brand in consumer electronics, try to establish interesting new projects. Great work-life balance, beautiful offices, nicely growing company.. Cons: In general: Dyson products were always protected against competitors by patents, so nobody in this company really knows what is a real competition on the market. This is why everybody at the company is so slow, calm, doesn't really interested in the work he is doing. I only can see obsession with technology on the marketing stuffs (or at competitors). Basically they are manufacturing the same vacuum cleaners for 25 years, no real improvements, only marketing, patents and recoloring the vacuums every year. This mentality will not work in the new categories. By points: - Extremely inefficient way of working. - No clear career path. You will have no chance as managers doesnt care about you. If you want a career, find a job at other company instead, this is the easiest way. - Low salaries. - No processes. They desperately tries to solve this, but I have a feeling that they are doing it without any experience (reason: either young employees or high level leaders without any industry experience). - Many Dyson staff thinks industry standards are the Satan. - Sometimes we are reinventing the wheel. - Very slow IT infrastructure. - Sometimes I feel, that only inexperienced engineers can be managers at Dyson. Only a few are exception. - Not clear weather we design things for James Dyson or for people. No problem with it, but cant see how it will make profit for the company or for James. - Sometimes no science behind decisions, only ego. - Desperately tries to be a technology company, but it is more like a concept design office. - Badly established management who has no real plan for the project, only ad-hoc daily to-dos. - Layout in the cafe is totally crazy, sometimes I have to stand in the queue for 15-20 minutes, only two cashiers for hundreds of employees (not a good design for a design company). - No free snacks. - Cafe opening time until 16:30, but staff close tills at 16:15. How it can happen? - Middle of nowhere. - Very young and inexperienced staff . - HR doesn't really care about feedback. - Nobody really cares about feedback. - Nobody really cares about anything.

9354,9354,,Dyson,5/1/2017,Dyson as a Graduate,5.0,"Pros: Dyson has a great training programme, and although at the time I worked there, you get started on a technical (but arguably menial task) one should appreciate that this is a 'test' - and that if it is done with skills and good attitude, this is invariably noticed and progression follows soon after. As much as it is tempting to think that fresh talent should not be 'blunted by the reality' of NPD (i.e. real world engineering), a spell there really enhanced my time in NPI, and helped me anticipate the potential pitfalls of product development, while remaining creatively ambitious. Dyson is a great 'finishing school' from University, and of course has huge scope to develop within the company to go beyond this.. Cons: As with any large organization, it is hard to 'stand out' - and often this is not about just being talented alone - but rather that you have the interpersonal skills and humility to work well with others, even if the initially do not share your perspective(s). This can be frustrating for graduates, who are used to a relatively 'fast' pace of progress and a corporate can feel more political.

If any issues do arise, there are solutions for them, including free phone support, a first class customer service department, excellent warranties and technical service and even free preventive maintenance in many markets. The job we do is also a benefit to our owners for follow-up questions about their products and helping them to get the very most from all their Dyson products. While there are some administrative tasks outside of the retail locations where we work, all work is paid for at the same rate, so we are encouraged to submit our admin work, training, work related phone calls, etc. I've worked with several managers -- all very professional and supportive -- some of the best I've ever worked with.

9452,9452,,Dyson,20/9/2015,midnight ride,1.0,"Pros: Always skeptical of entirely negative glassdoor reviews, I am quite happy to start with the pros: Dyson products are brilliant, brand reputation makes the company a good resume builder, and there are a handful of truly talented individuals working for this vacuum juggernaut. Sadly, the aforementioned list of pros is both terribly short and but a prelude to a laundry list of cons.. Cons: Let me be your personal Paul Revere. The British are not coming; they are here. Take a position at Dyson, but know you are signing up to fight a never-ending, non-revolutionary war. Con 1: Spin It I have worked for big brands in the past, but never has perception reigned so supremely over actual productivity and results. To succeed at Dyson, you must PR yourself, pillage coworker's wins and claim them as your own, and stay well beyond the standard workday simply for the sake of appearance. These characteristics are bred and lauded by senior leadership. Thus it is no real surprise that there is a cutthroat, toxic environment brewing - one where employees are forced to climb over one another like a horde of demons freshly unleashed from the bowels of the underworld. Con 2: Culture, Smulture Get ready to get bopped over the head with a slew of haughty phrases and lofty promises. At Dyson, employees are pitched on an open office environment that promotes communication, unlimited advancement opportunity and flex hours. Be warned: those are but traps. And crucially, it gets worse. The walls in the US office ooze cocksure quotes that are passed off as bits of the Dyson culture. They might have you believing you just beamed aboard the innovative express. Trust me, you have not. While the whiz kid engineers in the UK might be whipping up a sexy knew cordless vacuum - excuse me, ""machine"" - that will outlive planet earth, know that the US office actually crushes creative thinking. Oh the sad, sad hypocrisy. Con 3: Dyson's ""Visa"" Bill If you have read other reviews of Dyson on glassdoor, you have undoubtedly noticed one pattern that has literally repeated itself for years: ex-pats are given nearly every single leadership role in the US. This is likely do to the extreme success that the blokes and birds have had over the past few years. Utilizing their extremely limited knowledge of the American sales/marketing environment, they have managed to exponentially shrink US market share. (fancy claps) Con 4: Revolving Door The real Dyson culture promotes competition and lacks teamwork, transparency and overall tact, so it should come as no surprise that turnover is high. How high? So high - the type of turnover that has a quicksand effect on day-to-day business while simultaneously eating away at employee moral.",Anonymous Employee,"Chicago, IL",reviews,subjective,negative,
9454,9454,,Dyson,19/8/2015,Great Employer,5.0,"Pros: The best part about working at Dyson is the environment, they have fresh fruit delivered twice a week and even catered lunches 1 day a week. Managers are receptive to feedback and they always try to work and promote from within. The products are great, and the brand carries a lot of weight out in the marketplace..

9457,9457,,Dyson,11/8/2015,"People only comment on the worst, I'm sharing the good",5.0,"Pros: People seem to only leave messages on here to complain, few do so to highlight the good. Though I've not been in many other companies of employment, I honestly believe Dyson is one of the few companies where employees and general community feel is genuinely a highlight to working here. Everyone here is competent but not overly serious. You can have a laugh with line managers and department heads. Everyone trusts everyone to be doing their job properly, and rather than being reprimanded - mistakes are instead seen as areas of improvement and looked at from all angles, not just the individual. Everyone understands they happen. - Yearly Dyson Challenge that pits teams against one another to develop some innovative mechanism to overcome that year's challenge be it building a cart out of cardboard or hovercraft out of a dyson motor! - Average age is 25 - it's like being back at university! - Huge community focus with clubs and activities and events all year long organised very professionally. The Annual Christmas fancy dress parties are legendary - Competitive pay - Independence to get on with your work, or have a huge amount of help as you so choose. Everyone wants everyone to succeed, no one is out to 'get you'. Most criticisms come from people simply ensuring you're working safely. - Everyone is friendly and approachable - Recently introduced paths to professional accreditation (i.e. chartership) - Massive recruitment drive. Cons: - A fair amount of red tape and admin work, though no more so than any other large company I would imagine - Pay could be slightly more than 'competitive' to ensure retention. - While the 'underdog' attitude serves to embolden us, it can make us complacent not thinking the same large company attitudes should also apply to us. - I can only speak from an engineer's perspective. There is a divide, due to secrecy, between us and other areas of the company. - Expanding very quickly, a lot of moving around and nothing ever stays set for long. Same goes for standards and ensuring we don't forget what's already been done before.",Mechanical Engineer,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,subjective,negative,

9486,9486,,Dyson,22/12/2014,Fast-paced and fun!,5.0,"Pros: As a new college grad, I was looking for a company where I could use my brain, but also have fun. Dyson is the best of both worlds! Right off the bat I was given a large amount of responsibility managing an ad campaign. I was able to work with all parts of the business - marketing, legal, finance, logistics, sales, and graphics. Not only that, but we are a global company and I am able to work very closely with people from all around the world. Every day poses a new challenge and I get to interact with people constantly (a huge plus for me, because I don't like the idea of being chained to a desk in a cubicle). The group that works at Dyson is downright hilarious. They are also incredibly patient when it comes to helping out a new youngster in the office. And on that note, our office is amazing - a completely open floor plan (no cubicles!). As an entry level employee, I sit just a chair roll away from some of our senior management. Our management is wonderful - approachable and easy to talk to. (And they have a wonderful sense of humor! Yes this is a professional place, but that doesn't mean we don’t joke around). Do I even need to mention our products? They’re innovative, premium, and colorful! Working at Dyson is what you make of it. If you’re enthusiastic and happy, people will respond positively. You can make a great career at Dyson – the choice is yours.. Cons: As a company, Dyson has a very set way of doing things. I think as a company we need to step out of our comfort zone to move forward. As for Dyson’s employees, we should have more in-office activities and contests (happy hours, events in the café, raffles, lunches, etc.) I think Dyson is headed down the direction of obtaining that “work hard play hard” attitude that so many companies strive for, but we just need to hone into that together. The more our employees are able to interact, the more cohesive we will be, and the better we will work as a team.

High turnover among all levels and departments which also creates an everyone for themselves atmosphere.",Finance,,reviews,subjective,negative,
9495,9495,,Dyson,2/10/2014,"Fantastic Place to Work & Highly Recommend it, But There Are a Few Issues",5.0,"Pros: Dyson is a fantastic place to work which is tailored for individuals who can roll with the punches and enjoy new challenges, which might have been outside of their initial role’s scope. The work life balance is great since it incorporates flex hours, plenty of PTO & sick days, as well as great benefits package. On top of these great benefits you also can take advantage of a very generous discount program for the new products / technology which is released. The company has also gone through a bit of a re-org which has been fantastic for Dyson and I think it addresses many of the cons provided by the other reviewers. The new members of the management team (for the most part) have degrees that support their positions, experience in other industries that can be utilized to help Dyson progress, and they are very approachable. I specifically called out “for the most part” since that is where my input on what can be improved upon comes into play. Another great “pro” for the company is that they have realized the importance of recruiting and retaining talented employees. When I was first hired there was always a priority around the engineers, but the other departmental functions were a bit of an afterthought. With the new management team however, it appears that they have realized that every department is a necessary component which drives the business forward. Dyson has started addressing its online presence by responding to reviews (positive & negative), which I am huge proponent of. When purchasing a premium product with a higher price point, it is only natural to hop on the internet and start looking into customer reviews. This same principle is especially prevalent when looking for a new position, thus the popularity of Glassdoor. If I am going to leave my current employer and take a chance with Dyson, I want to see what past and current employees experienced. If I see a slew of reviews which all touch on how horrible Dyson is without a response, it only leaves me to assume that maybe these reviewers are not just sour with the company and have legitimate criticisms. Now that Dyson is responding to the reviews, it takes away the credibility of the reviewers who spouted on about how much Dyson doesn’t care about its employees. If the company is willing to have senior members respond to reviews, I can only assume that they care about the current and future employees a great deal.. Cons: Just like anything else in life there is a Yin to the Yang, so inevitably there are things that could be worked on. The only con that I have with Dyson is that some of the middle management (below director level & certainly not the majority) really have no idea what they are doing and are downright bullies. A select number of individuals have taken the union worker’s mind-set which I perceive as, hold my position for as long as I possibly can and not train those under me in order to retain my position. These individuals are narcissistic in nature and will continue to spout how much they are needed, but in reality if you need to make a case to why you should stay you probably are not needed. I refer to this phenomenon as “Bob Syndrome,” for those of you who have ever seen Office Space. Consultant:” What exactly do you do here Bob?” Bob (screaming): “I AM GOOD AT DEALING WITH PEOPLE.” The most unfortunate part about the situation is that their teams have great ideas and want to be innovative but are too afraid to do so. The team’s ideas never come to fruition since the bad middle managers will either bury the idea so it will never see the light of day or simply yell and berate you until you just won’t make any more suggestions. By doing this these types of individuals can hide the fact that their processes and procedures that they instilled have been horribly inefficient for years form their superiors. I have personally seen things that could have been done in minutes rather than hours and simple process change (Six Sigma) what would easily save upwards of $100,000 annually. It is very easy to spot these individuals, simply ask them a few very basic questions regarding what they claim to be experts in. I will guarantee that if you ask them for a simple document or report which pertains to their discipline that they will not be able to produce it while you are there. They will then find someone who actually has the skillset (either on their team or another), have them do it, and then return to you saying that they had completed it.",Anonymous Employee,"Chicago, IL",reviews,subjective,positive,

Failure is seen as a necessary step towards developing desirable and successful products. - Great corporate values. The company supports premier educational institutions in the UK, and also gives back to the community via James Dyson Foundation. Dyson pays his taxes. - Great perks and benefits - Great mix of people from a variety of cultural/ethnic backgrounds make for an interesting work environment. - The average engineer is about 26 years old. Their energy, ingenuity and motivation to work hard more than make up for their lack of experience. If you lack experience, there are also enough experienced engineers and managers in senior roles to learn from. - Employees take pride in their work. - Employees are quite entrepreneurial. Many have side projects and interests. - Continuous professional development is taken seriously. You will be learning all the time, and there are many whose only job is training and development of others in the company. Managers are happy to set budget aside to send people to international conferences, courses, and industrial events. - You will fly business class whatever your job title and wherever you go. - The company is located in a beautiful part of the country and commuting via little towns and villages on the way to work everyday is a pleasure. - Good, subsidised food from the on-campus Cafe, all locally sourced. - Most people car-share.

There is a massive lack of understanding of America in the US management team. It's not the UK or Australia, the US is much more progressive and advanced technologically.

Cons: Extremely incompetent management with very little emotional intelligence.

Unfortunately, the entire management team both in the US and many in the UK have a inflated view of how the world sees Dyson. We are not saving lives and often times, people have never heard of us nor care to learn more. The employees are not valued and seen as easily replaceable. Internally, there is constant discussion about how horrible the culture is and management knows this and yet, without shame, acknowledges that they don't care. People should feel privileged to work for Dyson and should expect nothing in return is their view.
