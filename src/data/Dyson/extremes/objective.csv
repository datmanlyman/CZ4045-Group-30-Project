Cons: - Dyson's management (VP level and below) are not trained to be people managers. Yes, they are fantastic at their jobs and help the company grow, but are not fit to be a people manager (during yearly 360 performance reviews, you aren't allowed to do a review on your manager, but only other people on the team that you work with). Management will care very little about your future at the company, unless you are a favorite (many managers have a lot of favoritism in the office- favoritism is based on your personality, not performance whatsoever). - Dyson oftentimes hires externally for high positions and rarely promotes from within, so if you are looking to grow with a company and learn from management/mentors, Dyson is not the best choice. - Formal project management processes don't exist, and management will do very little to formalize a real process. This leaves employees feeling overworked because of inefficiencies in the project management process. - Beware of false promises from HR in terms of salary increases, benefits, promotions, or even an international opportunity.

Cons: Now, on to the cons. Despite being around for the last 20+ years, it feels that the company has expanded too rapidly and whilst an extensive training program has been developed for people working within the contact centre, RDD has absolutely no such thing in place. The introduction talks are a brilliant way to bring people into the company, however, once those have concluded, you're left to fend for yourself in a sink or swim environment, which is incredibly stressful for the employee but also detrimental to the business and will only end up causing the business to shoot itself in the foot. - Lack of training beyond intro talks - Sink or swim attitude - Office politics - Hostility to any changes not suggested by management - Adherence to obsolete research methods - No explanation for how internal project develop",Anonymous Employee,"Malmesbury, England",reviews,objective,neutral,

9346,9346,,Dyson,27/2/2017,New Product Innovation - Not Particularly Interesting,1.0,"Pros: Some of the most intelligent, interesting and dedicated technical people you'll ever work with. A uniquely successful UK company that truly values engineering and innovation - when approached in a specific way in certain areas. You'll be part of a unique private company that is getting bigger and stronger. Great for students and inexperienced engineers and designers. Above average basic holiday allowance. Flexible start/finish time - mostly to avoid car park gridlock. Plenty of opportunities to learn new practical skills. Firm grounding in real world engineering principles and a 'seeing/building is believing' approach. New campus buildings are a step in the right direction for staff work environment. Daylight and outdoor areas now available to staff based in new non-converted factory buildings.. Cons: Cold, ambivalent treatment of people. Paranoid levels of secrecy and security. Think 1984. Lack of meaningful performance incentive with below market rate pay on a global scale. Engineers are much more highly valued in other developed countries and industries, a UK problem that is taken advantage of here. Pervasive arrogant attitudes and hubris due to recent success of company. Superiority complex. Believe they are still an underdog startup company whilst now being a large global corporate production and marketing machine. Even at quite senior levels, you are likely to be a tiny cog in this machine. If you want to follow your own path this place isn't for you. Ironic given how the founder became successful and how regularly you are told about it. Process/review driven culture fosters slow pace of development. Senior management are receptive to sycophantic behaviour traits. There are 'chosen ones'. Entitled sociopathic males appear to be treated favourably within RDD. Dull work environment stifles creativity of individuals - have to work in a certain way. Limited freedoms and few opportunities to grow as a professional in the wider world. Can't work flexibly from home or off site if work in RDD - mostly for security reasons. Unless you are one of a very select few in RDD, you won't be allowed to pursue your own ideas, you'll be working on other people's. The company is inward looking and in an isolated location - feels like a purple 80s prison on the edge of the Hot Fuzz film set. Your commute will be long. Unless you like the 'common good' and live local. Which not many can or want to. No cycle to work scheme.
