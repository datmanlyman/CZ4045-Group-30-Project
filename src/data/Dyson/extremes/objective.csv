7980,7980,Dyson,18/8/2020,The tragedy of what could have been...,1.0,"Pros: The people (many of them) - and this is the biggest disappointment of Dyson's current situation. Dyson is full of amazingly skilled and dedicated people, people who have given their all to work at the cutting edge of technology and design without necessarily receiving the rewards their contributions deserve. Looks good on a CV - known for hiring / growing / producing some of the most innovative talent in the space.. Cons: One of the many failures of the current leadership is the inability to harness the pride that many of us felt working for this organisation. It is heartbreaking to see so many talented and dedicated individuals to be taken for granted then dismissed in order to make a billionaire owner more money. What you hear in the press is the effect of COVID changing consumer behaviour but you don't see the record Quarterly sales driven through alternative channels and the increase in revenues that follows maintaining high margins on the products. Smoke and mirrors follow the restructuring decision and at a time where the billionaire owner could have easily swallowed any minor loss rather than releasing many people who helped him build his money stacks. The executive leadership should be ashamed of themselves, devoid of any humanity or people focus they are bleeding any good will out of the business, amplified by a comms team that don't understand the impact of poor social capital. There are many reasons to restructure and I am not naive enough to think employees are owed a living but there are WAYS to restructure and this was not it. The new CEO has shown zero emotion in his action since taking charge. Whether it be ordering an entire workforce back to site in the middle of an epidemic, schizophrenic messaging about the health of the company, or the emotionless way he announced restructuring he maintains the same non-plus attitude to the people who have served the business with such integrity and dedication. There is a deep seated lack of trust throughout the business and this is obvious in the constant messaging about Dyson being a ""Campus based business"" meaning if you're not on site and not visible then you can't be trusted to complete the work. There are teams working all hours to keep the business moving forwards during this period who do so without thanks or praise but are essentially being told they're not trusted to do the work required.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.3215,0.175325758,negative,positive

The company does not care remotely about its people and inhibits any progression. It is run like a dictatorship where there nothing is done for the good of the people or the employees. Policy and opportunity for employees is taken away last minute on a whim from leadership. Despite claiming to have a non-hierarchical work culture, this could not be further from the truth, you will be silenced by those above you. Don't be fooled by the adverts of international opportunities or the opportunity to progress quickly - the only employees who progress at any rate are either as a result of nepotism or sucking up to superiors and throwing colleagues under the bus. If you are not either of these then it will be difficult for you to advance in your career. The pay is well below market rate for role and experience and HR are utterly incompetent, working against employees, lying and even going back on information provided in writing.

Cons: All of the pro’s listed above however are negated by a toxic work environment. The removal of autonomy, the clear and unapologetic stance on flexibility and lack thereof, the erosion of trust (truly disappointing post a record year in 2020) have made for the perfect storm of attrition and sickness. The latter being particularly alarming, people of all levels, length of service, gender, differing departments and locations are being signed off daily for burnout, anxiety and a whole myriad of mental and physical health issues that is not being recognised or addressed. The working pace has always been fast but the current situation with a rapidly dwindling workforce means that those left have a unrealistic and unmanageable workload. When management challenge productivity and results and you respond that there isn’t anyone left in the business to deliver, you are told to ‘make it happen’.

8265,8265,Dyson,6/1/2022,How to lose your workforce in 2 years,1.0,"Pros: I am genuinely saddened to witness the decline in this company over the last 2 years. It has gone from a place of excitement and inspiration to a place that seems to sap joy from you as soon as you walk in the door. My team and manager were the only pros but unfortunately they have also left or are leaving.. Cons: Unfortunately as you will see from other reviews, the real start of this decline came from Dyson's reaction to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, workers were able to have agreements with their managers that allowed them to work flexibly. This unofficial working from home took place globally and dyson went from strength to strength, however James Dyson appears to not have known this was going on. Apparently he believes that you can only be effectively working if you are sat at your desk 5 days a week because in an office there is 'collaboration'. Anyone not in the office is then threatened with disciplinaries. This shows a great lack of understanding of the world we currently live in and how teams work effectively. The majority of teams at Dyson work in multiple countries, communicating effectively on Microsoft Teams with people they have never met in person. Please explain how being in a Dyson office 5 days a week would aid with this communication. If they asked (which they haven't), they would likely find that most people do want to spend some, most or all of their week in a office location but everyone would like to be valued and trusted enough to make those choices with the support of their managers. Employees are not necessarily asking for anything new with regards to flexible working, they are asking to go back to how it was pre-pandemic. The decisions over the past 2 years are really starting to show. Over half of the team I work with have either left in the last month, are serving their notice or are off sick due to stress. This is not just down to lack of flexible working but also the general disrespect Dyson shows to employees. External recruiters are well aware what is going on at Dyson and are using it as an excellent opportunity to steal talent. On the flip side, recruiting into Dyson is almost impossible. Surely Roland and James have been made aware of this? The CPO Laura says she wants to listen but listening sessions with People team are cancelled/rearranged multiple times and listening only works if you actually act upon the information you are given. There is also a lack of respect for her own team - making decisions without consulting SMEs shows lack of trust and understanding.

8274,8274,Dyson,2/1/2022,Last year was bad and its only getting worse!,1.0,"Pros: - Free food and coffee was introduced in September 2021. It was a pre cursor to the mandatory on site attendance (see below) and whilst the food is pretty sub standard...most it is free - Loads of car parking space for those that drive. If you dont, there is a coach from Bristol or Swindon that leaves as the sun rises - Helipad at the back if you own a helicopter too - The engineers working on new products are smart girls and guys and it can be a great experience to see a product from inception to delivery. Cons: - Dyson is falling apart from the top downwards. The decisions/statements from James regarding flexibility for employees is well documented. Roland as CEO has been an awful appointment. Zero personal skills or charisma and speaks like he has little to no care for employees. Outside of having an exceptionally white shirt all the time, he has nothing impressive or inspiring about him. - No strategy just relying on the good old Dyson name. Those in the know are aware of new product delays, issues with logistics and increasing competition. Things that most employees cant control but are blamed regardless - Leadership is layered with people who have been at Dyson for 10+ years and literally following a set type. White, middle aged men who often believe their job title because it has 'Director' in it they know everything and wont mind bullying and suppressing people along the way. Unless you are a graduate... - Graduates are seen are the saviour to everything despite coming into Dyson with minimal experience. Flocks of experienced employees are leaving, arent being replaced and Grads are promoted into levels they cant manage, have no experience and only know the 'Dyson way'. Which for the record isnt a good 'way' to follow. - Zero flexibility despite what Dyson will say. All of the return to campus stuff has been documented but working from home does not exist here - Employees are quite literally leaving in their hundreds. The main catalyst has been the lack of flexibility and the forced attendance on campus. What Dyson ignore/forget/dont realise or appreciate is many people had pre-existing arrangements to flexibility when they joined Dyson, pre-COVID. These were removed which has added so much disruption to peoples lives at a time when we are going through a global pandemic. The decisioning and communications from HR and Leadership have been unforgivably bad - HR is getting strangled by management/James over employee retention, flexibility and are being forced to quite literally monitor people who do or do not swipe their access badges on site. I cant really blame HR as they are following orders, but the impact on employee morale due to this has been crushing - Huge blame culture across some teams. And those teams are often led by the aforementioned Director level types who only really know how to survive and stand on others at Dyson to get promoted to lead a team - Too much focus on shiny stuff and forgetting the important things that will drive Dyon forward. Communications from James have been limited to him talking about his new book (employees had the option to buy that for slightly more than you could on a big ecommerce retailer). Website is buggy, terrible to buy from but James announces a new virtual reality experience to save the day...which it wont of course as the number of people who use VR is only marginally more than those that use the helipad at Dyson.

They'll give you a free panini on your half an hour lunch.. Cons: The lack of flexibility is well known, but it really is crazy. The company don't believe working from home is working at all. Obsessive, incredibly untrusting, and laughing in the face of the pandemic. During my time here, this inflexibility has brought on much worry that I'd get in trouble for asking for days working from home that weren't ""valid"". I am not somebody who has ever really experienced anxiety before, so that fact alone should tell you how it makes staff feel. The lack of compassion is crazy. Need a bit of time at home to look after an ill family member? Don't be ridiculous. You'll get a day, maximum 2, and be ready to fight for that. The company simply do not care for you or your mental health. At all. Who can be happy, working for a company, knowing that the company do not care about your family? ""If you can work you must be in the office, at your desk, regardless of anything else going on"". It's a militant, oppressive position, which is making people leave by their hundreds. Its a problem which seems to be getting worse, rather than better. They're making it harder and harder to work from flexibly, which makes it harder and harder to motivate yourself to crawl into the office. Still, _some_ are allowed to work from home right now, due to the new government guidance! How nice is that? ... they will be back in too early, at the earliest opportunity, putting themselves at risk for absolutely no reason. Secondly, the Covid policies are remarkably contradictory. Staff are made to wear masks all of the time, including at the very spaced out desks. Marshalls storm around and demand you keep them on at all times. If you're made to wear masks all of the time because the air around your desk is unsafe, it doesn't sound safe enough to be in at all to me. Wearing masks permanently is very very cautious, but that is where the caution ends. Staff are forced in regardless of anything else going on, with no testing (there's nothing at all stopping infected people coming into the office), there's very little social distancing when you're not at your desk - The crushes at lunchtime are especially dangerous. Thirdly, the company have actively taken away opportunities to hear feedback from its staff, such as removing the pulse survey. Any company which chooses to close its eyes and cover up its ears from its existing staff should be a major red flag. I know why they don't want to hear it, but actively avoiding the feedback is a really bad (and dangerous) thing. Lastly, due to reasons I've listed above (and more) the the mood and the morale of the place, and therefore the culture of the place is absolutely horrendous. As described above, it causes tremendous worry and stress, and hearing stories about how the company has treated others in worse situations than me does not leave me with any reasons to feel excited or passionate about this company. People are leaving (or have left) in their masses, it amazes me that alarms aren't going off because the company is haemorrhaging staff. Long term members of staff, and new ones too. Maybe it's redundancy by exodus? There are companies doing great things right now, valuing and treating their people well. This is not one of them.

Most of the health and safety team have left so if you fancy a go making something really dangerous with some of the best resources around crack on. Also if you do it fast and dangerous you’ll be rewarded. I’ve seen more control in a pre COVID kebab shop at 2am on a Saturday. Oh and there is free food in the canteen, but it’s not exactly worth the price. You may have an impromptu long term stay on the porcelain throne if you win lunch roulette. Great regular chances to go for exercise, trying to find a toilet free can take a nice 10mins out of you day and boosts the step count. There are actually some genuinely nice people who really care about the place. They all sad to see the place they have invested years in being carelessly trashed by a maniac and an eccentric billionaire.. Cons: Honestly I’m not sure where to start, it’s quite painful to be part of, you feel a sinking feeling turning up to work knowing that there will be some wonderful cluster to deal with by the end of the week. It might be another classy announcement to get back into the office again or your sacked. Sent of Friday night after hours! Or maybe we’ve just made some of you team redundant surprise! Oh and btw we still want to double dyson so if you can make up the slack that would be grand. Or there is flexible working dears but if you actually use it we will hunt you down and demand to know why you weren’t on site even though we told you you could. Or the latest don’t to what the government tell you, we know best, stay working at your desks we are watching. The way employees are treated is quite historic, you will be a number here. You will be paid below the industry average because you are working for the great dyson and you should be thankful that we let you in the gate. I’m not sure if we actually have any great products in the pipeline, most are just paint jobs or reactionary, not the great inventions that they once were producing. It’s all about producing something in such short time scales that everyone on the project goes out with stress. If I were betting I would wager that the talent that has left has struck a possible mortal blow. There does seem to be very little pre thought to some of the decisions so you will learn to be dynamic with the truth when asked. The last belter, don’t spend anything until next year. That stopped most of dyson RDD for 2 days until someone saw sense. It’s like someone left Roland in the pub on Friday night with his phone and told him don’t txt the company. It’s all quite sad as this once great company circles the drain, hopefully it’s not allowed to sink but my advice, don’t join, but watch as it might get back to being great again.

Cons: Basically feels like a car crash where every day you see more damage and realise how bad it is, with no plan to fix it: - Board unable to make decisions and just say yes to James and Roland - No direction of where Dyson needs to be in 3-5 years and how they going to get there - A lot (can repeat a lot) of outsourcing to multiple companies across a number of departments (HR, IT, Finance ....). No internal knowledge and capability. Lots of 3rd party staff working at Dyson, who do not care about the company and just follow a simple process as their contracts dictate. - Make operating model changes every 18 months but never actually land the new ways of work or the new structure and just causes more ambiguity, less accountability and makes it more difficult to move an inch forward - A revolving door of people leaving across all departments. And since they have draconian HR policies the roles are not being filled. This leaves those individuals who are still in the company covering for 2 if not 3 people as the board and leadership teams all expect the same amount of work and output no matter how few people are left.

8321,8321,Dyson,24/11/2021,Not the company it once was.....,1.0,"Pros: Dyson recently introduced a whole range of new benefits to UK employees recently, including free lunches/drinks/fruit, plus things like on-site GP, hair dresser, EV salary sacrifice scheme, but these are viewed as little more than bribes to soften the blow of making it mandatory to be in the office 5 days a week. Unfortunately the fruit rations run out by 10am, the meal queues are huge, and the quality and size of portions has declined dramatically since being introduced. Many of us would rather pay a few quid to get a decent choice!. Cons: None of the above however can make up for some of the shocking HR policies implemented by the business in the last 18 months, which have served to create an incredibly negative atmosphere amongst the staff that are still here, and driven away the many fortunate souls that have sought alternative employment recently (or simply quit without jobs to go to or retired early!). The worst example of this for me was when the Exec team (or more likely JD) decided to force all staff back into the office during the first lockdown, despite the government clearly stating that anyone that could work from home must do so. We all received an email late on a Friday night telling us we had to return to the office on Monday, however this was followed by another email on he Saturday saying that this was no longer the case - basically due to a staff revolt! That was definitive proof that JD valued the success of his business over the health of his employees and their families. That was the moment that I decided I no longer shared the values of the company had spent years working for and contributing to. Since then, things have got progressively worse - staff satisfaction surveys have been abandoned so there is no way for employees to express their views anonymously (except via Glassdoor!); 5 day attendance on campus is now compulsory, with all staff monitored by HR for attendance. Morale is also further impacted by the unrealistic targets that the business now is tasked with achieving over the coming years due to the 'Double Dyson' strategy, which basically means doubling profits, doubling the amount of new projects, whilst at the same time halving the development time and cutting costs. With so many experienced and knowledgeable people leaving (or have left), this makes this even harder to realise. Dyson has always been a fast paced and dynamic place to work, but this new strategy seems doomed t failure. Unfortunately all this can be traced back to the very person that made Dyson such a success in the first place. All decisions on HR policy and working decisions seem to lead back to his door, with both CEO and CPO either unwilling or unable to influence him. The working conditions are completely out of step with modern practices, and it is clear from what internal recruiters are saying that this is having a serious impact of being able to both retain and recruit staff. And I haven't even mentioned yet the fact that it has been many years since we actually launched an innovative and successful new product! The failed Electric Vehicle project burnt through half a billion pounds before being scrapped, and as a reward for leading this terminated project, JD installed Roland as head of the entire company!

I would never have accepted the job if I had to come in 5 days a week and the management knew this, but did nothing about it other than shrug their shoulders. I've never been treated so awfully by an employer. The company is literally running daily reports on who scans their ID card at the office, so if you don't scan and you haven't booked annual leave or are taking a sick day you will be threatened with disciplinary action. It's honestly as bad as it sounds. I wish I'd listened to all of the negative reviews on here before accepting their offer.

The people remain great but most are, quite sensibly, leaving en-masse.. Cons: Where to start... I wouldn't be able to fit this all in one review. However here are some of the most recent items to give you a flavour. They are generally focused on the great work of the 'back to work' functions. In the UK, they have established 'punching in', such as would be found in a car factory of the 60s. The owner is genuinely worried that people are taking advantage of him, that they have aggressively been making people come back into the office (#campusculture), even when there are multiple COVID cases reported each day. The 'Return-to-work' scheme therefore was rolled out like the annual 'back-to-school' campaign at ASDA, without any of the jolliness. Workday absence status is matched to your security pass being used on the door. Everyday the people function have to manually go and chase those who haven't clocked in to see what they are up to. If you still don't have a valid reason (there aren't many these days) then you are put on a naughty list which is sent to the CEO and owner. Work from home/flexible working is NOT allowed. If you need to not go to the office one day you need to log it in the system. Car breaks down, kids are sick, doctors.... Dyson have to know what you are doing. It reminds me of being at school again! To top it off there are also monitors who patrol the office and cafe asking if you are vaccinated and that you need to wear your mask at all times. In Singapore, teams are again made to go in despite a government mandate stating work from home is the norm. Instead they have to submit a covid test every sunday before the week of productivity ahead. Those who want to leave the country are actively and aggressively discouraged through threats of losing their job or having to take unpaid leave. COVID updates on this are sent in a very militant manner. Although travel is perfectly legal now from Singapore, albeit with caveats and process, people function are asserting their power with no regard for peoples personal situation. If you need to do a work from quarantine, this is not allowed (who knows why when we have been working remotely for a year)... To travel you are forced to sign a document which states the right to terminate you and not be paid if there are any changes to your plan. Then a member of the executive committee have to approve it to 'grant' you the permission to leave. As an aside, the culture has been all but crushed in the company. There is no spirit, no leadership and a lack of direction on the most part. Moral is through the floor and at the same time we are being told we need to double the profit in 4 years. However, no one knows how we are going to do it. I could go on, but that's enough for now.",Engineer,"Bristol, England",reviews,objective,positive,,,0.8398,0.175445088,positive,positive

As a manager promoting really good people is made very difficult. If you do take a job here, negotiate hard on the way in as getting a payrise is notoriously difficult. Good, experienced people leaving all over the place. One of the worst things I noticed before I left was the CEO, in small group meetings (PR nonsense) saying that there was no evidence that recruitment and retention was affected by the ‘no working from home’ directive. I left almost solely for this reason and wasn’t given an exit interview. None of my peers were. Staff were never consulted about how they wanted to work post pandemic. If you don’t ask these questions you don’t get the answers you don’t want, right? Bottom line is you won’t feel valued if you work here.

It simply cares about making more money, and if that means sacking people in the middle of a global pandemic, then so be it! A lot of people on here point to Robot Roland (our CEO), which I don't think is particularly fair. This all stems from James Dyson. As he's got older and richer he's become more and more disengaged from the company. He's got much greedier, arrogant and bitter, (you know what they say, as you get older your worst traits come out stronger). Back to Robot Roland, think of him as an empty suit. He takes his orders in the Boardroom and duly issues them out, even if they are beyond what's legally allowed (like forcing staff back into the office during a national lockdown). What our CEO and Founder have failed to realise is that we are not robots, we are not here just to make a bitter old man richer.

Cons: Don't know where to start with this place... Senior management can't manage they are literally promoted on length of service and not on ability. They will say you need to be in role at least 1.5 years before promotion/changing roles, however this isn’t the case, so its misleading and dishonest. Work-life balance is a myth in this place, and you are expected to work all hours with literally no preparation or acknowledgment for your efforts. Leadership (chaos) under new CEO Roland "" robot"" Krueger has shifted heavily towards cost saving and cares more about profit than wellbeing of staff. He has a personality of a rock and after making 900 staff redundant he spent literally 1 minute talking about it, and quickly switched back to their fantasy about competitors and sales targets. Forcing staff to campus during pandemic and during lockdown (you will disciplined if you refuse, engineers have complained to guardian about this!). Literally made staff sit in outdoor tents for lunch just so they can get staff on campus during pandemic, my colleagues’ hot breath was more effective than the heaters in that tent. Chaotic and reactive is understatement, literally everything is done off the back of something happening in the business, so its never planned for or proactive. For example, they told everyone to come back to site after 5pm (after 1st lockdown) on a Friday to start again on Monday, only to reverse the decision 24 hours later cus they are so out of touch with people’s life outside of work. They bang on about these three values which literally make no sense and senior management do not act these values so how can staff follow this, please someone tell me!!! Culture of blame and no accountability, managers would rather throw you under the bus to save their own back than stand up for you. Literally no focus on diversity, apart from 3rd party cleaning staff who are lovely and the Reaction to BLM was embarrassing, company did nothing apart from an email weeks after events. No head of diversity and inclusion in 2020!! Wouldn’t be surprised if this company hired a white, 50+ private educated man for this role… lol Literally no woman on the board, so its just a bunch of men making decisions, how do they expect change and alternative decisions and outcomes?! The most siloed business on planet earth, I get product confidentially, but the communication is non existent between business areas and departments. Dyson will bang on about “change”, “fast paced”, “not for everyone” and you need to “be dyson”. However, this just covers up the sheer incompetence of the business. The reason they ask about managing change at interview (atleast 5 times) is because they u turn more than boris johnson, and cant make a decision so you have to deal with it. It not about changing with the times and technology as you would expect. The induction is the best ive been to, they show you the science, investment, engineers, products, let you take apart a machine, but in reality this just covers up the bad side of the business and after one month I was like wow they really sold me a lie in that induction. Dyson invested in a multi-million pound HRIS system because there were no global processes or about 20 systems in use globally prior to 2020. However, the data was so poor and they provided no training the system is a complete mess after 1 year and managers don’t know what they doing or how to use it. They recently layed off 900 staff “due to covid, when in reality this was because the company hired for too much growth which doesn’t exist. Some staff even layed off twice in 2020 can you imagine the stress of this? However, despite the above some of the people are wonderful and they keep you going during the daily chaos. The engineers create some amazing products, however I expect many staff to leave this place after their actions in 2020. You need to have strong mental health to take a career at this place cus boy it will break you down day by day until you cannot take it anymore/ cant perform your job.

Cons: Out spoken Brexiteer, first round of redundancies, ventilator PR story*, ultimatums to come back to the office during COVID, second round of redundancies. Senior management especially the CEO are totally disconnected from the values and personality of 'old' Dyson. Greed has set in. (*I truly respect the engineers and teams who put hard work into this but the way it was hyped up to the press was totally damaging overall and I believe against the government guidance for the initiative.) You used to be proud when someone asked where you worked, not anymore. It seems the PR team and leadership are so desperate to cover up past criticism they try and turn everything into a good PR story. It just ends up embarrassing and the brand has been severely damaged over the last few years. The new CEO is here for one reason, cut costs and increase profitability so one man can still have his dividend at the end of the year. There is a clear lack of regard and lack of skill around how to keep people motivated and inspired. People given 'high-performing' rating for 2019 performance had their bonus cut to standard at the very hint of a global crisis, and as always, most found out from their friends or rumors rather than official communication from the management. I understand this in another company but when its the UK's richest man saving a few million, it's a bit miffing. Then again, this is the same man who later ditched 900 'sales and repair' staff in the middle of a recession, blaming COVID . The way it was announced was just as calculated, a ten minute webcam briefing from the CEO explaining that although sales are good, we need to get rid of people. Turns out only around 50-60% of those were 'sales and repair', lots of project managers, engineers, heads of department, quality, HR etc. were swept under the rug. The latest embarrassment is the debacle surrounding 'return to work', first there was the u-turn, now there is daily reports where managers are asked daily on the percentage of staff they have back in the office. Functional leaders are spending there days chasing people into the office so that they don't get pulled up by the management.

There are some great job opportunities if the right people like you. I have some amazing colleagues who work so hard to get projects out faster and cheaper than ever.. Cons: Where to start? Used to be quite fun and exciting. Now slow, hierarchical and predictably disappointing in terms of people policy. - Absolute shambolic management of return to work. Asked us to come into work in May despite government advice still being to work from home. Email sent after hours on a Friday, to come back in on Monday. Officially they retracted it, but offline they still made us come in. This was 8 weeks before government advice changed. - Have misled the company and press about the redundancies, suggesting that retail was struggling due to COVID. Most of those made redundant aren't retail people. Loads of engineers were made redundant. They've used COVID as an excuse to thin the herd, cut costs and line James' pockets even more. Just be honest about it. - Robot Roland. Yet another Dyson CEO claiming that they are the one who truly does care about people. And then proceed to do the absolute opposite of caring for people. Monthly business updates delivered with no charisma or interest - the redundancy announcement was abysmal - delivered with absolutely zero empathy. I've never experienced such an uninspiring leader and don't feel good for the future of the company if this is the best we've got. I don't think he cares though. - There is a complete mismatch between the way Dyson portrays itself as an employer vs. how they actually are. They want to be taken seriously as a tech brand, but offer none of the forward thinking opportunities or ways of working that tech companies offer. As a result we can't recruit young or fresh talent, so we do the same things over and over again. It's been made clear that we are not a work from home company whilst lots of other companies right now have learned during COVID that they can trust their employees to work remotely, and that recognising this wins their employees' respect and loyalty. Dyson has none of that trust. We're told to make sure we take holidays and rest, but if you go on holiday and have to quarantine on the way back, you'll need to take that as unpaid leave. - Lack of diversity at leadership level is worse than ever. Middle aged white men jostling for power and calling all the shots with no interest in ideas or input from anyone else.

Most are just glorified salesman who have blagged their way up the ladder. Good coffee and a nice location in the countryside. I met some decent people here but most have now left.. Cons: Staff moral is at an all time low; the VP’s, Director’s and CEO constantly bang on about how much money the company is making & how amazing we (the staff) are, however they still don’t reward appropriately or appreciate the staff when it counts. If you don’t fit the Dyson mold of being privately educated, have the gift of the gab, and preferably partake in upper class extra curricular activities then you’ll struggle to get on, as only the favourites get promoted. You could work for years to improve Projects and delivery but get no appreciation. Obsession with rig building, reviewing things to death and Visuals overshadow the not so glamorous Engineering guts of the project. I believe the Upper management fundamentally don’t know how to run a company properly as most have never worked anywhere else. The place has out grown most of them. Many decisions are made on egos and personal gain, not for what’s best for the Business. Middle managers are obsessed with building their own empires and pushing themselves up the pecking order, rather than doing what’s best for the Business. Even if your manager fights your corner it will be likely be ignored and overruled by a Director. In summary a shiny pretty enticing shop front, but a rotten core to this Company, run by people that really don’t seem to care about the staff at all. If you’re privately educated and can give a good salesman pitch with all the jazz hands you’ll get on; if you’re a proper hard working Engineer who delivers good quality work and you are from a non-priviledged background then you will struggle to progress – Go and work for a proper Engineering company instead and actually be appreciated.",Engineer,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9692,0.223062016,positive,positive

They won't listen to anyone with external experience on subjects they know very little about and cant see how stupid they look trying to talk about such topics. To put this into perspective - they are still trying to solve/develope knowledge on a problem that exists across multiple electronic/PCB projects for over 5 years which other ""technology companies"" would laugh at. I tried to tell them how my previous company dealt with this issue when I joined Dyson but I was branded as an idiot for speaking out.

9065,9065,Dyson,25/3/2019,Do not look after talent,1.0,"Pros: Cafe. Interesting and varied work. Dyson is a great success story but -. Cons: Dyson have been paring back staff reward for years in order to control total staff cost. First they removed performance related pay rises and gave a higher bonus. Saving the company a fortune but hitting staff salary progression. Then they froze promotions. Saving the company a fortune but hitting staff salary progression. Then they decided that they had better look like they care about staff reward, so introduced a new performance conversation culture and made all the right noises about rewarding high performers and awarding smaller pay rises and bonus to underperforming staff. Sounds good. The trouble is, the process to decide who gets what is not based on objectively measured contribution, but on a few managers in a room ranking everyone in their team based on what they can remember them having done in the two weeks before that meeting (forget everything they have achieved in the last 12 months). Then, even if that list is somehow a relatively fair reflection of the high and low performers in the team, it then goes to HR for 'calibration', at this point if there was any objectivity it quickly gets steam rollered by the overriding strategy of the exec to reward as little as they can possibly get away with. The more you earn, the less likely you are to get a higher % payrise or bonus than the 'default' award (because that's more expensive for Dyson). Junior staff are most likely to get extra and that way Dyson can boast that they rewarded x000 staff for high performance... and still keep the cost to a minimum. They look like they care about staff reward and thus keep the staff sweet... Happy days!

It makes for weird politics and unaligned decision making. The high numbers of imported ‘talent’ from agencies and beauty brands often means you get people who don’t buy into the companies brand success and simply moan about how things are, rather contributing.

Then join a different company, as James does not want your ideas, he wants your time, to create his. -The management are lifers!! This brand has an awful processes that bottlenecks with one man, meaning good designers and engineers with ambition leave. If you stay too long you won't be able to function in the real industry. So the best leave and the ambition lacking get promoted early, accepting they are there for life and that the slow, bottleneck approach is good. This in turn means they will not understand why so many people are upset with the process. Also, not much point complaining as they know that all issues start and finish with James dyson, and he won't change. -This is a company that has got lucky a lot. They take young grad's not because the want youth, energy and imagination, but because they don't know the right way to do things, so they accept the dyson way with no questions.

9344,9344,Dyson,27/2/2017,New Product Innovation - Not Particularly Interesting,1.0,"Pros: Some of the most intelligent, interesting and dedicated technical people you'll ever work with. A uniquely successful UK company that truly values engineering and innovation - when approached in a specific way in certain areas. You'll be part of a unique private company that is getting bigger and stronger. Great for students and inexperienced engineers and designers. Above average basic holiday allowance. Flexible start/finish time - mostly to avoid car park gridlock. Plenty of opportunities to learn new practical skills. Firm grounding in real world engineering principles and a 'seeing/building is believing' approach. New campus buildings are a step in the right direction for staff work environment. Daylight and outdoor areas now available to staff based in new non-converted factory buildings.. Cons: Cold, ambivalent treatment of people. Paranoid levels of secrecy and security. Think 1984. Lack of meaningful performance incentive with below market rate pay on a global scale. Engineers are much more highly valued in other developed countries and industries, a UK problem that is taken advantage of here. Pervasive arrogant attitudes and hubris due to recent success of company. Superiority complex. Believe they are still an underdog startup company whilst now being a large global corporate production and marketing machine. Even at quite senior levels, you are likely to be a tiny cog in this machine. If you want to follow your own path this place isn't for you. Ironic given how the founder became successful and how regularly you are told about it. Process/review driven culture fosters slow pace of development. Senior management are receptive to sycophantic behaviour traits. There are 'chosen ones'. Entitled sociopathic males appear to be treated favourably within RDD. Dull work environment stifles creativity of individuals - have to work in a certain way. Limited freedoms and few opportunities to grow as a professional in the wider world. Can't work flexibly from home or off site if work in RDD - mostly for security reasons. Unless you are one of a very select few in RDD, you won't be allowed to pursue your own ideas, you'll be working on other people's. The company is inward looking and in an isolated location - feels like a purple 80s prison on the edge of the Hot Fuzz film set. Your commute will be long. Unless you like the 'common good' and live local. Which not many can or want to. No cycle to work scheme.

9450,9450,Dyson,20/9/2015,midnight ride,1.0,"Pros: Always skeptical of entirely negative glassdoor reviews, I am quite happy to start with the pros: Dyson products are brilliant, brand reputation makes the company a good resume builder, and there are a handful of truly talented individuals working for this vacuum juggernaut. Sadly, the aforementioned list of pros is both terribly short and but a prelude to a laundry list of cons.. Cons: Let me be your personal Paul Revere. The British are not coming; they are here. Take a position at Dyson, but know you are signing up to fight a never-ending, non-revolutionary war. Con 1: Spin It I have worked for big brands in the past, but never has perception reigned so supremely over actual productivity and results. To succeed at Dyson, you must PR yourself, pillage coworker's wins and claim them as your own, and stay well beyond the standard workday simply for the sake of appearance. These characteristics are bred and lauded by senior leadership. Thus it is no real surprise that there is a cutthroat, toxic environment brewing - one where employees are forced to climb over one another like a horde of demons freshly unleashed from the bowels of the underworld. Con 2: Culture, Smulture Get ready to get bopped over the head with a slew of haughty phrases and lofty promises. At Dyson, employees are pitched on an open office environment that promotes communication, unlimited advancement opportunity and flex hours. Be warned: those are but traps. And crucially, it gets worse. The walls in the US office ooze cocksure quotes that are passed off as bits of the Dyson culture. They might have you believing you just beamed aboard the innovative express. Trust me, you have not. While the whiz kid engineers in the UK might be whipping up a sexy knew cordless vacuum - excuse me, ""machine"" - that will outlive planet earth, know that the US office actually crushes creative thinking. Oh the sad, sad hypocrisy. Con 3: Dyson's ""Visa"" Bill If you have read other reviews of Dyson on glassdoor, you have undoubtedly noticed one pattern that has literally repeated itself for years: ex-pats are given nearly every single leadership role in the US. This is likely do to the extreme success that the blokes and birds have had over the past few years. Utilizing their extremely limited knowledge of the American sales/marketing environment, they have managed to exponentially shrink US market share. (fancy claps) Con 4: Revolving Door The real Dyson culture promotes competition and lacks teamwork, transparency and overall tact, so it should come as no surprise that turnover is high. How high?

9455,9455,Dyson,11/8/2015,"People only comment on the worst, I'm sharing the good",5.0,"Pros: People seem to only leave messages on here to complain, few do so to highlight the good. Though I've not been in many other companies of employment, I honestly believe Dyson is one of the few companies where employees and general community feel is genuinely a highlight to working here. Everyone here is competent but not overly serious. You can have a laugh with line managers and department heads. Everyone trusts everyone to be doing their job properly, and rather than being reprimanded - mistakes are instead seen as areas of improvement and looked at from all angles, not just the individual. Everyone understands they happen. - Yearly Dyson Challenge that pits teams against one another to develop some innovative mechanism to overcome that year's challenge be it building a cart out of cardboard or hovercraft out of a dyson motor! - Average age is 25 - it's like being back at university! - Huge community focus with clubs and activities and events all year long organised very professionally. The Annual Christmas fancy dress parties are legendary - Competitive pay - Independence to get on with your work, or have a huge amount of help as you so choose. Everyone wants everyone to succeed, no one is out to 'get you'. Most criticisms come from people simply ensuring you're working safely. - Everyone is friendly and approachable - Recently introduced paths to professional accreditation (i.e. chartership) - Massive recruitment drive. Cons: - A fair amount of red tape and admin work, though no more so than any other large company I would imagine - Pay could be slightly more than 'competitive' to ensure retention. - While the 'underdog' attitude serves to embolden us, it can make us complacent not thinking the same large company attitudes should also apply to us. - I can only speak from an engineer's perspective. There is a divide, due to secrecy, between us and other areas of the company. - Expanding very quickly, a lot of moving around and nothing ever stays set for long.
