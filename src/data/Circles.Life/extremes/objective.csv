Mainly due to the endless pivots and short-sighted ideas the founders attempt to launch and believing the management they've put in place will deliver, when in reality they are not suited for their roles or the objectives of the company.. Cons: The culture of the company is the worst I have seen. Toxic, and it is a pure reflection of the many insecurities the founders have and their urge to make an exit rather than building the company they boast about in the townhalls, and no one believes them. This comes partly because they do not have management experience, and mostly because they've put in place managers who merely act as ""yes-men"" and are grossly incompetent. This results, in managers becoming extremely political because they are continuously scrambling for resources to cover up for their lack of knowledge. They started with an amazing product to bring down costs vs big telco players, but it was as clear as daylight that the big players in the market took a nanosecond to adjust prices and compete. Now Circles is not growing its subscriber base since mid 2020, furthermore it is disregarding it's other markets (Taiwan is closing) because they realized that the MVNO model doesn't work any more. Take a look at their marketing strategy, it is as simple as throwing money at subscribers to keep them. Not sustainable in time. This has pushed the founders to pivot to the B2B model and become to big telcos, what Grab & Uber are to the ride hailing industry. They boast about their Circles-X platform and how they can solve the 20-year old problems the industry has had. However, as we all know, all of Circles' tech is based on Oracle (+90% of it). Even to the point that Circles doesn't even have a registered IP because it did not develop anything. Then there's the CSOP plan which everyone bought into thinking they had upside in the company. Only later to find out that the plan had many irregularities, specially after the company brought in a private equity fund. Word around is that CSOPs are worth nothing because they are not tied to equity, but also that the Founders have cashed out in the latest funding round. This is very frustrating. Then there's HR & Talent, which continuously keeps on walking out the door because they become frustrated or because they are tired of the politics and having to deal with the incompetency of managers and the lack of willingness of founders to listen to alternative points of view.

There is a high chance that they might fire all the engineers in the Singapore office or force them to leave.

11538,11538,Circles.Life,22/9/2020,[BEWARE] If you are smart run as far as possible from this company,1.0,"Pros: *May get to work on a variety of things. Breadth wise learning can happen depending on your interest and the level at which you join. But, if you are looking to sharpen your skills then you will get disappointed. *People and culture team - the only ones still trying to create positive environment in the company *Town hall meetings *Wednesday Lunches[depends on your taste though] *On time salary *Marketing team - Backbone of Circles. Cons: I wish I could say take this big feedback with a pinch of salt and there are shades of grey here and there. But, when the complete environment is shady, it's my duty as an engineer to warn others. Here are some factual points - 1) Management - Manager's who have joined recently seem to be better than the existing lot, let's wait until they become part of this system, or leave. Old ones just benefited and became managers because of sticking with the company for a long time and don't have the people management skills, or right technical skills, or both management and technical skills 2) Politics - From top to bottom it is there. It's not an engineering company but a political setup 3) Pressure - You won't know the reason but there is a constant pressure 4) Poisonous - The more you stay in this company, more bad it will do to you personally and professionally 5) Learning - They give few ""chosen"" employees some online courses coupons, others are neglected as they are just labours. You need to be favoured by your manager for this, some genuinely hard working guys are also given this benefit, but the ratio is [1:5::good:mediocre] 6) CSOPs - BIGGEST SCAM, in the last one year policy w.r.t. awarding of CSOP's was changed almost every month. It was done to deny you CSOP's in every way possible 7) Exits - Many people were handed pink slips. People were fired in the worst possible way, no professionalism even when parting with your own employees. Looking at the mayhem, and the unstable environment, many good people quit themselves out of self respect, as they didn't find this company worthy enough to put their career on the line 8) Marketing heavy - It's a big marketing setup where starting from founders to CTO they know how to sell subpar things at good prices and raise funding. Check the advertisements of Circles.Life in Australia and cat videos in Singapore, if these resonate to you, then please go ahead. Also, I hope you are smart enough to have figured out how there are many 5 star ratings [no brainer - added by HR team]. Look at recent exits in the HR team and you would know the situation 9) Bonus and Hike - 0.5 months of bonus to most, 1 month bonus to chosen ones. No hike was given to most citing different stories, no consistency even among stories 10) Space cadet and explorer - ANOTHER SCAM. If you feel hard work can help you become one, you will be disappointed. Most of the people who have got these fancy rewards won't even find a decent job in a good company outside. It's just a mechanism to retain people who have created dependency in company 11) Growth - hahaha, no growth in any terms. No clear career progression roadmap defined. Every month starting last 1 year a new timeline was given about releasing career progression and role definition guide 12) Hierarchy - People report to anyone and anyone can become manager/lead[literally anyone], true for more than 75% of the lot. Look at the profile of the people with whom you are supposed to work, or to report, before you accept the offer. Also, refer to point no 1 when making the decision about joining this company 13) HR - Bunch of spineless people. Worst I have experienced so far in my career, they are the ones who just want to lay policies to fire people, and don't care about how to make people grow. But, I pity them, due to the condition outside they are just doing everything asked to save their own jobs 14) Employee benefits - No insurance for family, it only covers employee, no memberships, no education support, monthly phone bills can be reimbursed [here comes the surprise - you need to submit bills every month for the same, thing as simple as this in a TELCO company, where founders/CTO in one breath compares Circles to FAANG is not automated] Circles.Life company motto is to run fast and the company name has circles in it. Company name itself should give you a cue, as a circle means no direction. Fill in the blank puzzle for ""Physics"" fans ? When you run around a circle with the speed of light you end up ...?... yourself. If you have figured out the blank, you have already proven that you are smart. I don't need to convince you more about what to do or not to do. If you want to work in a madhouse, like to work with people who would talk about random things which wont make any sense, want to learn big technical jargons, want to learn about how not to build a product (engineering as well as product wise), then you are lucky to have found this company.

11545,11545,Circles.Life,31/7/2020,Circus Life at Circles.Life,1.0,"Pros: Can't think of much - maybe just the perks of having your telco bills paid for?. Cons: TOXIC WORK CULTURE: You're expected to work overtime and on weekends/holidays. It has become such an expectation that it has permeated throughout the whole organization. It gets frowned upon or even ""escalated to your superiors"" if you do not provide ""timely support"" (even outside of working hours). NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE: Especially if you're at the working level. You can find yourself easily working 18-hour shifts on weekdays. Meetings are arranged on weekends and sometimes on public holidays. If you do see any other reviews that claims that there is plenty of work-life balance here, they are probably at the top managerial level where they do all the talking and none of the heavy lifting. CLUELESS LEADERSHIP: The CEO is known to prefer yes-men over those who are opinionated but genuinely have good ideas, but the founders and senior management have little clue on how to bring the business forward. The lack of business acumen and relationship management is appalling, as the constant cherry-picking and indecisiveness have caused the company to lose out on potential growth opportunities and new revenue streams. Instead of rectifying this, the leaders have been sugarcoating the lack of growth with big words and fluffy ""motivational speeches"". CAREER REGRESSION: Earlier in 2020, the company laid off a huge number of employees due to over-hiring from the previous two quarters, but chose to blame it on the employees for being poor performers. Many co-workers joined for a specific role but was eventually asked to work on a totally different scope as early as one or two months into their employment.",Product Manager,Singapore,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.6968,0.059156217,negative,positive
11554,11554,Circles.Life,22/5/2020,Considering? DON'T. You have been warned.,1.0,"Pros: Stocked pantry with snacks, coffee machine and tea. Amazing company LinkedIn profile that makes Circles look glorious on the outside. Telco bill reimbursement, group medical insurance.. Cons: Too many to list down. but here are a few. Things started going downhill since last year. Glassdoor rating was as high as 3.7 just a year ago, but now a pathetic 2.4 and this is NOT for no reason. - Multiple “restructurings” happened and people got laid off since last October. Used to joke that Thanos appeared in Circles because every few weeks there were layoffs, but it has since evolved into a fear culture that these jokes aren’t even funny anymore. We were tricked into believing every single lay-off was “the last one” in the company’s exact words. And then it happened, and happened, and happened again and again. - High turnover rate. Most good people are leaving the company because of the turn of events that have happened. Many are looking for an exit. Ask around, even recruiters from other companies know about it, we were told during interviews with other companies. - Don’t trust anything the recruiters tell you if it is not written in your offer letter. Don’t be naive. Make sure everything is in the OFFER LETTER that you sign and not only in the email, or worse still if it’s just verbally told to you. When questioned why salary adjustment was promised by recruiters but not granted, the company’s response was “we did not commit to that if you check your offer letter”. Wow, amazing. You won the legal game. Many people even for those who have worked for >1 year did not enjoy any salary adjustments last year, and for those who got it, it was way lower than market rate. Do you want your pay to be stuck at the same range even after working for a few years? Think twice because when you move on to other jobs, companies will base their offer on your current pay, which means you are kinda stuck. - Management here abuses the word “ownership”. Taking ownership means you are expected to firefight, churn and deliver within tight timelines and most of the time losing your work-life balance. The CEO said firefighting is in our company spirits. What? - Process changes all the time without elaborate planning and systematic execution. You are told to follow this process today, two-three weeks later they would change their mind and tell you to follow another process, and the cycle keeps repeating. You will find yourself being caught up with processes instead of focusing on learning and developing your skills in the company. - Insanely KPI-driven. If setting exceptional goals to appease your boss and working overtime to meet KPIs is how you enjoy working, welcome to Circus. Oops I meant circles. To people who are considering to take up job offers from Circles, if you do not want to constantly worry about job security, fearing that you will be fired anytime after seeing your colleagues being let go one after another, being stuck in an infinite loop of working like a robot to deliver within tight timelines but learning nothing, no pay increment, DON’T JOIN. You have been warned. Fresh grads especially, please look elsewhere. You deserve better. Don’t be tricked by the glorious social presence of the company. Always try to speak to engineers (engineers on the ground, not managers, not recruiters) in the company first before joining one, and for circles specifically, you will understand why there are so many negative reviews on Glassdoor.",Software Engineer,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.8981,0.070366193,positive,positive

They view everyone as disposables, and will retrench you without warning, while spinning blatant lies to survivors. If you don't do as they tell, they'll say you're not living up to company values such as taking ownership. When the management does nothing to prove their worth at all, or take any ownership.

They keep clutching at straws trying to find something to please the 3 co-founders. At the management level, there's a lot of toxicity.

11595,11595,Circles.Life,30/4/2019,Wouldn't recommend this as a place to work,1.0,"Pros: This is no doubt a very ambitious company. They truly focus on- and deliver what customers need. Management is also very performance-focused, but maybe too much (more on that later), there are some very smart and hardworking people in the company. Unfortunately, my experience working here had more cons than it did pros.. Cons: Lacking transparency - They claim to have transparency in the form of sharing business results/performance goals/roadmaps, but many important business decisions are still made behind closed doors. You hear of/see new ""business partners/consultants etc"" joining the current team with no proper introductions made, and Management only addresses these when people start asking questions/express unhappiness. Reactive, not proactive. Feedback - Don't know if they still do it now but the co-Founders held ""open door sessions"" and encouraged employees to come in and give honest feedback. Pure lip service. They listen to reply, not to understand; most of the time are very defensive, making excuses, and not committing to change things at all. This behaviour was also present in the HR leadership then. Poor management culture - You'll see many other reviews here talking about their miserable management culture. (Applies to majority of Managers, not all) Extremely focused on results, yet they don't celebrate how we get there. Minimal appreciation for team members; once you reach your goal/target, another is put in front of you for immediate action. This is not wrong at all, but without proper and SINCERE appreciation shown, it's bad for employee motivation. Micromanagement is experienced by MANY teams, which trickles from the co-founders themselves. They also seem to think monetary rewards = employee motivation, which brings me to my next point.. Inadequate HR leaders - The leader(s) in the HR team (or as they call it internally : ""People & Culture"") need to seriously rethink their understanding of employee motivation and building a positive workplace culture. High level of unhappiness and turnover, overall workplace culture is not ideal, some senior employees bully the junior folks, yet HR doesn't do anything when these are reported. Also, I can say for a fact that most of the positive reviews here are indeed ""planted"", and were arranged by HR themselves. There are people hired into the company because of connections with Founders, without any formal selection process, and HR just goes ahead with no (or minimal) objections. I do wanna point out that this team has grown considerably large and pulled in a few new talents in lead positions. Hopefully this is for the better... As mentioned by a few others here, this place has a disproportionate focus on growth/profit, over employees. Understandable in a high-growth startup, but that doesn't mean you ignore employee morale and feedback. Turnover is not an issue to management, they have the mindset that people are very easily replaceable. I mentioned before that this is an ambitious company, but it borders a lot of times on being arrogant/obnoxious. Management consistently boasts about how the company is ""more than a telco"", and puts themselves in the ranks of Grab, Gojek (in terms of their success in Indonesia) but honestly they haven't really developed that much as anything more than just a telco. And with this same arrogance, they assume people are dying to join the company, but at the same time not offering competitive packages at all. Office location is also simply not attractive, but again, Management sees this as a non-issue in attracting talent. They really need a serious reality check. (If you've seen their latest Marketing stunt on the papers in Apr 2019, dissing their competitors in such an unprofessional way, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say they're obnoxious) Overall, from a consumer POV, Circles.Life is a top contender.

Our homes were flooded and we had no electricity. In these trying times, it was great to know that the company leadership thought about us and took meaningful steps to help out. Our salaries were credited ahead of time. Each one of us in the PH office got a care package. And, the leadership showed great empathy by relaxing timelines on things that had to be turned around or, catered to..

11672,11672,Circles.Life,30/5/2020,Pathetic Company to work for,1.0,"Pros: 1) Less work. People do try to follow 9am-5pm schedule 2) Good compensation 3) Business trips to Singapore. Cons: 1) Company has a lost vision 2) Peers are pretty much average from local colleges 3) The biggest issue with this company is the senior management. They can fire you anyday without giving any prior notice or warning. They will take you to a meeting room and will ask to submit your laptop and leave immediately. Such is the unprofessional behaviour of the management. And it was happening for people from entry level to Director level. 4) I was part of the Bengaluru office which had about 35 employees when I joined. During my tenure of 3 months, I saw about 10 people quitting themselves and 15 people getting fired. I was not any of the fired ones, but I quit myself seeing the unstable nature of this company. Nobody was sure what is going to happen next. 5) During my tenure I also saw office boys and talent acquisition people getting fired. It was like nobody was spared. 6) Looks like they were planning to close off the Bengaluru office, but the way it was done was terrible. 7) All this started happening after the new CTO joined the company. Any questions related to firing were termed as organisational changes. Really a bad CTO from my perspective. 8) Overall they had a very buggy system in place, where even monthly bills of customers had huge errors reported every month.",Senior Software Engineer,Bangalore,reviews,objective,negative,,,-0.8912,0.039393939,negative,positive
11678,11678,Circles.Life,28/2/2020,Axed employees who helped launch internationally then called them redundant,1.0,"Pros: 1. My team respected work-life balance and helps each other out with on-call events even during weekends or holidays. Team also respected the fact that members are scattered across countries. 2. That’s about it.. Cons: 1. Other departments in SG office seem to not care about demographics of other countries and appear to believe that what succeeded in SG will “surely” succeed in other countries. 2. Lack of information sharing between teams, sometimes even among team members, where as long as you weren’t in SG office, you were considered as “must comply by all or any means.” Often creating last-minute requests and calling said requests as “urgent.” Mind you, this didn’t happen in my team but has happened to another colleague in another team. 3. High-level management sets up SLA for alerts then creates alert policies that are shorter than said SLAs, thus showing lower MTTA numbers. 4. Some managers, when asked questions or criticized in monthly town halls, choose to give light answers or ignore the questions entirely. 5. Axed the people who helped launched locally in TW and AU, then called them redundant. Hey, at least show them the gratitude they deserve for helping Circles.Life come “The first international telco.” 6. Made it look as if the most recent lay-off move was to let go of the bottom 10% performers. That wasn’t the real reason we were given when we were let go.",,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.8597,0.05,positive,positive
