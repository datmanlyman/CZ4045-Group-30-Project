Cons: • Slavedriving culture - Long working hours can be expected. You can literally work from 9 am all the way to 9 pm, and that's the norm. I've seen folks have to work past midnight and even regularly on weekends. • No respect for personal time - You're pretty much expected to work or be on standby 24/7. The founders and senior managers will text you outside of work hours and during the weekends, and you are expected to work on things immediately. Even when you are on leave. • Lousy CEO - Your typical ex-consultant who knows how to talk big but cannot execute. Pretty much sums up the lack of leadership to steer the company out of its current mess. He claims he listens to feedback but actually he doesn't. He surrounds himself with people who feeds him with validation instead of good ideas. • Culture of Dishonesty - This company is built on a web of lies and admittedly strong marketing. On the surface, this looks like an innovative company. Underneath, it's just a patchwork of makeshift blocks put together to look like a functional business. Fake it till you make it - claims to be the best telco in Singapore but doesn't even provide decent network coverage for most of it. • Meagre compensation - To be fair, they do pay the market average.

Cons: 1. People, esp senior leaders oftentimes curse [using tasteless profanities that might sound more in place at a mobster movie by Martin Scorcesse] and yell very loudly in meetings. 2. There's a strong belief that outputs = outcomes. Consequently, there's a crazy pressure to deliver software with a near disregard for the outcomes 3. No triaging of bugs [or triaging of anything really]. Even if ONE customer complains about a bug on the website, PMs and Engg are expected to drop everything to get on a call with the customer to repro and fix the bug. If you have spent even one day as a PM / Engg on consumer products, you will realize how unsustainable this can be. 4. Backstabbing and politics. Now, I have spent 12 years of my life in various Engg and PM roles and have seen a fair bit of office politics. But this is a whole new level. I have had a case where an owner of a different vertical launched his product knowing fully well that there is a dependency on my area and gave me 2 hrs notice. Our team had to then scramble to meet arbitrary deadlines 5. Uninspiring colleagues. Mostly fresh college grads with a massive ego.

They won't let you quit until they ground your confidence to the ground and make you depressed. Every time numbers are presented, it has to be what they want.

Cons: 1. retrenchment exercise was a joke. employees were let go without dignity, told that they were let go and expected to return assets within an hour or two the same day. no damage control, no sympathy. during the meeting, told some employees they were being let go because business needs changed, but after that newspaper reports and even a Glassdoor review below mentioned that people were let go due to performance/ productivity issues (if you fire entire teams in Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, and India, are you sure you're doing right by the employees if you said they were bad performers?) in my pov, a company that does this to their employees have 0 respect and you would be better off not joining lest you face the same situation. 2. promises stock options but gives nothing as a non senior management employee, esops promised were never exercised or given. many people have left and are unable to exercise their stock options (we paid to have them) and I'm not even sure about the legality of their practices. 3. lack of transparency. company wide townhalls questions are vetted beforehand, and founders/ leadership team prepare their answers. expect 3 minute answers that are vague and promise things far off in the future without really getting to the point. 4. huge superiority complexes, founders and senior management believe ""if you dont fit our culture, then maybe this isnt the place for you"".

Except these, a lot of other things are bad.. Cons: Cons: 1) The culture is last-minute culture. They do not understand that things need to be properly planned and executed. If they need something for the weekend, they will only raise last-minute on Friday evening and call you “blocker” if you don’t work on Friday night or weekends. 2) Many bad managers are around (although new managers seem to be good). Bad managers will not protect the team and they will not care about the wellness of the employees. Instead of finding out why there are so many last-minute requests (from number 1), managers will just ask the employees to work on weekends. If you do not work on weekends, they will mark you as “under-performer” and just let you go. They basically treat employees as slaves and expect to work 24/7. 3) During town hall in front of everyone, department head likes to say that they are building the best place to work and grow and weekends work are not expected. Yet after the town hall behind the scene, they will still ask employees to work on weekends. 4) Poor work-life balance 5) Performance review is very biased based on “personality favoritism” and not on actual performance. Even if your performance is decent, if you make 1 mistake, you may be asked to go. However, those people who are performing nothing will stay in the company for long. 6) They do not know how to scale or plan ahead. When engineers work on issues, they only care about fixing the issues in the short-term without thinking about long-term scalability, stability, sustainability or security. Many people in tech team call themselves as tech person but they are not even familiar with those concepts. So there are many recurring issues because things were not properly done in the first place. It may not be engineers fault because they are all over-worked because of bad managers above (from number 2). 7) Founders make mistakes and wrong decisions at the expense of employees, like closing down Australia and Bangalore office, laying off many people across all regions and giving less than 1-month bonus with 0 increment. 8) No job security. You may be let go anytime. We cannot trust the founders. After Australia and Bangalore office closed, founders mentioned in the town hall that there would be no more laying off. Soon after that town hall, laying off in Singapore started. 9) Positive reviews here are doubtful because employees are asked to write good reviews and they are asked to put themselves as “Shareholder” on LinkedIn. 10) Out of my 10 years of working experience, Circles.Life experience is the worst ever.

Perks are abundant at Circles.Life, food, snacks, drinks, coffee.. Cons: A very unforward-thinking organization. 1) Clear over-hiring practices during scaling for an asset-light company, and then performed several retrenchment/firing exercises (only join if you're looking to use them as a stepping stone). 2) Claim to be fast-paced, but sets yearly OKRs, which are not realistic due to the nature of the industry and competition, etc. Even though they tried adapting the quarterly OKR model, no clear methodology was used to deploy the new process. 3) Had more than a year to develop the ""ecosystem"" that they've always touted to investors, but chose not to. The evidence of this was the demolition of the ideathon practice where they encouraged employees to contribute new ideas for new relevant products or verticals. Key unresolved issues within the top management. A) The '3-cofounder' model is clearly a tactic to absolve themselves from mistakes and responsibility. They refuse to nominate 1 CEO. Each co-founder supposedly has a clear portfolio to manage, but in reality, they overlap, thus small issues can take months to resolve due to disagreement among themselves. If you're looking for a company with strong leadership, give this one a pass. B) They are clearly inexperienced handling a company of this size and stage. Even the CTO seems to be better equipped in handling the direction of the company. Hold on, why is there a CTO if there are no C-suites? Dishonesty is the core of this company. i) For all the talk about bonuses and stock options, they never kept their promises. Terms in the contract are intentionally made vague (it's technically legal, so there's no case to bring to court). If you've been offered a role, please question the HR hard because you can be sure they can't give specifics. ii) Their transparency is a farce as important communications to employees keep dwindling. They also don't address legitimate issues that have been raised in meetings and townhalls. The values and mission they keep selling are never seen in the 3 co-founders, so don't expect anyone else to exhibit them! iii) You'll be surprised to find out that there's no fixed date for payroll as well.

11652,11652,Circles.Life,8/1/2022,I should have listened to past reviews and never entered this company,1.0,"Pros: - Very data-driven in all things. - A handful of coworkers who are genuinely helpful.. Cons: - No respect for time. They own your evenings. ""Lunch break"" is mere formality because it is not properly observed. If they want you to join a sudden meeting at 12:35pm, you join. You could be literally starving but it's not their problem. - Also about time, expect some colleagues to think like your life revolves on them alone and you have no one else to deal with. Their demands are heavy for very little time given to you. (to be fair, some are quite understanding) - If you are new to your job, they don't care. There's no such thing as margin for error. When it comes to maths, forecasts, and numbers, it's either you get a number right to the hundredths decimal or you are a failure at your job. Not to mention there is ZERO support or mentorship to begin with. I was my own mentor and simply learned off mistakes. I learned everything the hard way. - One minute they say ""we don't want you to be overburdened"", then later on they give you the opposite what they say - Most of the people interactions I had was when I'd be dumped some work to do or I'd be told ""how could you do this terribly wrong"", i.e. being off by 0.002% in my number forecasts. - Weird org structure. Your role can be technical in nature but be in a department/team where everyone else is non-technical. Hence, the lack of mentorship/guidance and support system, I suppose. This company scarred me and destroyed my confidence in myself. I wish I never joined Circles. I've been to terrible companies before Circles but this company is something else.

If you can shout out loud and show off, then great opportunity to climb the ladder fastly.. Cons: This company has always had some immature people like recruiters sending out wrong messages in terms of salary and stocks to new joiners. Interviewers selecting overqualified people without knowing what is the role and responsibility they are hiring for etc. But from mid-September, an unprecedented downturn is going on. It all started with the sudden unexplained firing of pioners who helped set up the company in the first place. This followed by layoffs and overdoing things to do the damage control. Their sole objective is now to quantify profits in every aspect with zero people management skills. This quantification is so much so that they even quantified bonuses and appraisals breaking clauses in offer letters which guaranteed a minimum bonus, which is illegal and the company deserves to be sued for this. What they don't realize is this can create a hostile environment as people can start firefighting to gain promotions and appraisal by hook or crook. With people being let go, credits for work not being given if their work doesn't seem to contribute to the company's profit. A lot of people feel beaten down, cornered and uncertain about what is the next turn going to be. Amidst all these, they are still punting it back to the employees calling it ""If you don't believe in leadership then you are not the right fit"". Leadership has no clue how to uplift the morale of the employees lacks empathy. They want people to completely surrender and suck up to the management and make them feel miserable so that they can be easily controlled or rather enslaved. Nobody is happy with newly appointed leaders who have made everything about themselves(some happy people are either naive or also among those who lack empathy, very few in number ), crushing everyone on their way, they are on spree to weed out every possible threat to secure their job.
