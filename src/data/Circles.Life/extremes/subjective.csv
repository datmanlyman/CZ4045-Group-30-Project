Cons: • Slavedriving culture - Long working hours can be expected. You can literally work from 9 am all the way to 9 pm, and that's the norm. I've seen folks have to work past midnight and even regularly on weekends. • No respect for personal time - You're pretty much expected to work or be on standby 24/7. The founders and senior managers will text you outside of work hours and during the weekends, and you are expected to work on things immediately. Even when you are on leave. • Lousy CEO - Your typical ex-consultant who knows how to talk big but cannot execute. Pretty much sums up the lack of leadership to steer the company out of its current mess. He claims he listens to feedback but actually he doesn't. He surrounds himself with people who feeds him with validation instead of good ideas. • Culture of Dishonesty - This company is built on a web of lies and admittedly strong marketing. On the surface, this looks like an innovative company. Underneath, it's just a patchwork of makeshift blocks put together to look like a functional business. Fake it till you make it - claims to be the best telco in Singapore but doesn't even provide decent network coverage for most of it. • Meagre compensation - To be fair, they do pay the market average.

There's a strong belief that outputs = outcomes. Consequently, there's a crazy pressure to deliver software with a near disregard for the outcomes 3. No triaging of bugs [or triaging of anything really]. Even if ONE customer complains about a bug on the website, PMs and Engg are expected to drop everything to get on a call with the customer to repro and fix the bug. If you have spent even one day as a PM / Engg on consumer products, you will realize how unsustainable this can be. 4. Backstabbing and politics. Now, I have spent 12 years of my life in various Engg and PM roles and have seen a fair bit of office politics. But this is a whole new level. I have had a case where an owner of a different vertical launched his product knowing fully well that there is a dependency on my area and gave me 2 hrs notice. Our team had to then scramble to meet arbitrary deadlines 5. Uninspiring colleagues. Mostly fresh college grads with a massive ego.

11516,11516,,Circles.Life,1/3/2021,The Fyre Festival of Telcos,1.0,"Pros: After 2 years, the only pro I see left in the company is the sense of camaraderie among colleagues that think alike and different to the management of the company. 2 years ago there was a sense of purpose to actually deliver a better product, but that is lone gone. Mainly due to the endless pivots and short-sighted ideas the founders attempt to launch and believing the management they've put in place will deliver, when in reality they are not suited for their roles or the objectives of the company.. Cons: The culture of the company is the worst I have seen. Toxic, and it is a pure reflection of the many insecurities the founders have and their urge to make an exit rather than building the company they boast about in the townhalls, and no one believes them. This comes partly because they do not have management experience, and mostly because they've put in place managers who merely act as ""yes-men"" and are grossly incompetent. This results, in managers becoming extremely political because they are continuously scrambling for resources to cover up for their lack of knowledge. They started with an amazing product to bring down costs vs big telco players, but it was as clear as daylight that the big players in the market took a nanosecond to adjust prices and compete. Now Circles is not growing its subscriber base since mid 2020, furthermore it is disregarding it's other markets (Taiwan is closing) because they realized that the MVNO model doesn't work any more. Take a look at their marketing strategy, it is as simple as throwing money at subscribers to keep them. Not sustainable in time. This has pushed the founders to pivot to the B2B model and become to big telcos, what Grab & Uber are to the ride hailing industry. They boast about their Circles-X platform and how they can solve the 20-year old problems the industry has had. However, as we all know, all of Circles' tech is based on Oracle (+90% of it). Even to the point that Circles doesn't even have a registered IP because it did not develop anything. Then there's the CSOP plan which everyone bought into thinking they had upside in the company. Only later to find out that the plan had many irregularities, specially after the company brought in a private equity fund. Word around is that CSOPs are worth nothing because they are not tied to equity, but also that the Founders have cashed out in the latest funding round. This is very frustrating. Then there's HR & Talent, which continuously keeps on walking out the door because they become frustrated or because they are tired of the politics and having to deal with the incompetency of managers and the lack of willingness of founders to listen to alternative points of view. This only leaves the wrong type of people in the company, or those who need to stay in it because of EP issues, and that number is significantly high and founders use that as leverage when negotiating salaries.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: I wish I could say take this big feedback with a pinch of salt and there are shades of grey here and there. But, when the complete environment is shady, it's my duty as an engineer to warn others. Here are some factual points - 1) Management - Manager's who have joined recently seem to be better than the existing lot, let's wait until they become part of this system, or leave. Old ones just benefited and became managers because of sticking with the company for a long time and don't have the people management skills, or right technical skills, or both management and technical skills 2) Politics - From top to bottom it is there. It's not an engineering company but a political setup 3) Pressure - You won't know the reason but there is a constant pressure 4) Poisonous - The more you stay in this company, more bad it will do to you personally and professionally 5) Learning - They give few ""chosen"" employees some online courses coupons, others are neglected as they are just labours. You need to be favoured by your manager for this, some genuinely hard working guys are also given this benefit, but the ratio is [1:5::good:mediocre] 6) CSOPs - BIGGEST SCAM, in the last one year policy w.r.t. awarding of CSOP's was changed almost every month. It was done to deny you CSOP's in every way possible 7) Exits - Many people were handed pink slips. People were fired in the worst possible way, no professionalism even when parting with your own employees. Looking at the mayhem, and the unstable environment, many good people quit themselves out of self respect, as they didn't find this company worthy enough to put their career on the line 8) Marketing heavy - It's a big marketing setup where starting from founders to CTO they know how to sell subpar things at good prices and raise funding. Check the advertisements of Circles.Life in Australia and cat videos in Singapore, if these resonate to you, then please go ahead. Also, I hope you are smart enough to have figured out how there are many 5 star ratings [no brainer - added by HR team]. Look at recent exits in the HR team and you would know the situation 9) Bonus and Hike - 0.5 months of bonus to most, 1 month bonus to chosen ones. No hike was given to most citing different stories, no consistency even among stories 10) Space cadet and explorer - ANOTHER SCAM. If you feel hard work can help you become one, you will be disappointed. Most of the people who have got these fancy rewards won't even find a decent job in a good company outside. It's just a mechanism to retain people who have created dependency in company 11) Growth - hahaha, no growth in any terms. No clear career progression roadmap defined. Every month starting last 1 year a new timeline was given about releasing career progression and role definition guide 12) Hierarchy - People report to anyone and anyone can become manager/lead[literally anyone], true for more than 75% of the lot. Look at the profile of the people with whom you are supposed to work, or to report, before you accept the offer. Also, refer to point no 1 when making the decision about joining this company 13) HR - Bunch of spineless people. Worst I have experienced so far in my career, they are the ones who just want to lay policies to fire people, and don't care about how to make people grow. But, I pity them, due to the condition outside they are just doing everything asked to save their own jobs 14) Employee benefits - No insurance for family, it only covers employee, no memberships, no education support, monthly phone bills can be reimbursed [here comes the surprise - you need to submit bills every month for the same, thing as simple as this in a TELCO company, where founders/CTO in one breath compares Circles to FAANG is not automated] Circles.Life company motto is to run fast and the company name has circles in it. Company name itself should give you a cue, as a circle means no direction. Fill in the blank puzzle for ""Physics"" fans ? When you run around a circle with the speed of light you end up ...?... yourself. If you have figured out the blank, you have already proven that you are smart. I don't need to convince you more about what to do or not to do. If you want to work in a madhouse, like to work with people who would talk about random things which wont make any sense, want to learn big technical jargons, want to learn about how not to build a product (engineering as well as product wise), then you are lucky to have found this company.

Cons: 1. retrenchment exercise was a joke. employees were let go without dignity, told that they were let go and expected to return assets within an hour or two the same day. no damage control, no sympathy. during the meeting, told some employees they were being let go because business needs changed, but after that newspaper reports and even a Glassdoor review below mentioned that people were let go due to performance/ productivity issues (if you fire entire teams in Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, and India, are you sure you're doing right by the employees if you said they were bad performers?) in my pov, a company that does this to their employees have 0 respect and you would be better off not joining lest you face the same situation. 2. promises stock options but gives nothing as a non senior management employee, esops promised were never exercised or given. many people have left and are unable to exercise their stock options (we paid to have them) and I'm not even sure about the legality of their practices. 3. lack of transparency. company wide townhalls questions are vetted beforehand, and founders/ leadership team prepare their answers. expect 3 minute answers that are vague and promise things far off in the future without really getting to the point. 4. huge superiority complexes, founders and senior management believe ""if you dont fit our culture, then maybe this isnt the place for you"".

It gets frowned upon or even ""escalated to your superiors"" if you do not provide ""timely support"" (even outside of working hours). NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE: Especially if you're at the working level. You can find yourself easily working 18-hour shifts on weekdays. Meetings are arranged on weekends and sometimes on public holidays. If you do see any other reviews that claims that there is plenty of work-life balance here, they are probably at the top managerial level where they do all the talking and none of the heavy lifting. CLUELESS LEADERSHIP: The CEO is known to prefer yes-men over those who are opinionated but genuinely have good ideas, but the founders and senior management have little clue on how to bring the business forward. The lack of business acumen and relationship management is appalling, as the constant cherry-picking and indecisiveness have caused the company to lose out on potential growth opportunities and new revenue streams. Instead of rectifying this, the leaders have been sugarcoating the lack of growth with big words and fluffy ""motivational speeches"". CAREER REGRESSION: Earlier in 2020, the company laid off a huge number of employees due to over-hiring from the previous two quarters, but chose to blame it on the employees for being poor performers.

If they need something for the weekend, they will only raise last-minute on Friday evening and call you “blocker” if you don’t work on Friday night or weekends. 2) Many bad managers are around (although new managers seem to be good). Bad managers will not protect the team and they will not care about the wellness of the employees. Instead of finding out why there are so many last-minute requests (from number 1), managers will just ask the employees to work on weekends. If you do not work on weekends, they will mark you as “under-performer” and just let you go. They basically treat employees as slaves and expect to work 24/7. 3) During town hall in front of everyone, department head likes to say that they are building the best place to work and grow and weekends work are not expected. Yet after the town hall behind the scene, they will still ask employees to work on weekends. 4) Poor work-life balance 5) Performance review is very biased based on “personality favoritism” and not on actual performance. Even if your performance is decent, if you make 1 mistake, you may be asked to go. However, those people who are performing nothing will stay in the company for long. 6) They do not know how to scale or plan ahead. When engineers work on issues, they only care about fixing the issues in the short-term without thinking about long-term scalability, stability, sustainability or security. Many people in tech team call themselves as tech person but they are not even familiar with those concepts. So there are many recurring issues because things were not properly done in the first place. It may not be engineers fault because they are all over-worked because of bad managers above (from number 2). 7) Founders make mistakes and wrong decisions at the expense of employees, like closing down Australia and Bangalore office, laying off many people across all regions and giving less than 1-month bonus with 0 increment. 8) No job security. You may be let go anytime. We cannot trust the founders. After Australia and Bangalore office closed, founders mentioned in the town hall that there would be no more laying off. Soon after that town hall, laying off in Singapore started. 9) Positive reviews here are doubtful because employees are asked to write good reviews and they are asked to put themselves as “Shareholder” on LinkedIn. 10) Out of my 10 years of working experience, Circles.Life experience is the worst ever.

We were tricked into believing every single lay-off was “the last one” in the company’s exact words. And then it happened, and happened, and happened again and again. - High turnover rate. Most good people are leaving the company because of the turn of events that have happened. Many are looking for an exit. Ask around, even recruiters from other companies know about it, we were told during interviews with other companies. - Don’t trust anything the recruiters tell you if it is not written in your offer letter. Don’t be naive. Make sure everything is in the OFFER LETTER that you sign and not only in the email, or worse still if it’s just verbally told to you. When questioned why salary adjustment was promised by recruiters but not granted, the company’s response was “we did not commit to that if you check your offer letter”. Wow, amazing. You won the legal game. Many people even for those who have worked for >1 year did not enjoy any salary adjustments last year, and for those who got it, it was way lower than market rate. Do you want your pay to be stuck at the same range even after working for a few years? Think twice because when you move on to other jobs, companies will base their offer on your current pay, which means you are kinda stuck. - Management here abuses the word “ownership”. Taking ownership means you are expected to firefight, churn and deliver within tight timelines and most of the time losing your work-life balance. The CEO said firefighting is in our company spirits. What? - Process changes all the time without elaborate planning and systematic execution. You are told to follow this process today, two-three weeks later they would change their mind and tell you to follow another process, and the cycle keeps repeating. You will find yourself being caught up with processes instead of focusing on learning and developing your skills in the company. - Insanely KPI-driven. If setting exceptional goals to appease your boss and working overtime to meet KPIs is how you enjoy working, welcome to Circus. Oops I meant circles. To people who are considering to take up job offers from Circles, if you do not want to constantly worry about job security, fearing that you will be fired anytime after seeing your colleagues being let go one after another, being stuck in an infinite loop of working like a robot to deliver within tight timelines but learning nothing, no pay increment, DON’T JOIN. You have been warned. Fresh grads especially, please look elsewhere. You deserve better. Don’t be tricked by the glorious social presence of the company. Always try to speak to engineers (engineers on the ground, not managers, not recruiters) in the company first before joining one, and for circles specifically, you will understand why there are so many negative reviews on Glassdoor.",Software Engineer,,reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: They will guilt trip you into doing things you don't like or find unethical. Such as hiring and firing people at will, finding loopholes to exploit in their relationships with employees. They view everyone as disposables, and will retrench you without warning, while spinning blatant lies to survivors. If you don't do as they tell, they'll say you're not living up to company values such as taking ownership. When the management does nothing to prove their worth at all, or take any ownership. They just hide behind their order barks, and expect everything to be handed on a silver plate. Worse, management is not qualified nor capable. They keep clutching at straws trying to find something to please the 3 co-founders. At the management level, there's a lot of toxicity. Politics are rife and people are all looking out for themselves. In year end party and previous company events, management and other senior employees recognised as space explorers and cadets made fools of themselves by taking advantage of each other while drunk.

Perks are abundant at Circles.Life, food, snacks, drinks, coffee.. Cons: A very unforward-thinking organization. 1) Clear over-hiring practices during scaling for an asset-light company, and then performed several retrenchment/firing exercises (only join if you're looking to use them as a stepping stone). 2) Claim to be fast-paced, but sets yearly OKRs, which are not realistic due to the nature of the industry and competition, etc. Even though they tried adapting the quarterly OKR model, no clear methodology was used to deploy the new process. 3) Had more than a year to develop the ""ecosystem"" that they've always touted to investors, but chose not to. The evidence of this was the demolition of the ideathon practice where they encouraged employees to contribute new ideas for new relevant products or verticals. Key unresolved issues within the top management. A) The '3-cofounder' model is clearly a tactic to absolve themselves from mistakes and responsibility. They refuse to nominate 1 CEO. Each co-founder supposedly has a clear portfolio to manage, but in reality, they overlap, thus small issues can take months to resolve due to disagreement among themselves. If you're looking for a company with strong leadership, give this one a pass. B) They are clearly inexperienced handling a company of this size and stage. Even the CTO seems to be better equipped in handling the direction of the company. Hold on, why is there a CTO if there are no C-suites? Dishonesty is the core of this company. i) For all the talk about bonuses and stock options, they never kept their promises. Terms in the contract are intentionally made vague (it's technically legal, so there's no case to bring to court). If you've been offered a role, please question the HR hard because you can be sure they can't give specifics. ii) Their transparency is a farce as important communications to employees keep dwindling. They also don't address legitimate issues that have been raised in meetings and townhalls. The values and mission they keep selling are never seen in the 3 co-founders, so don't expect anyone else to exhibit them! iii) You'll be surprised to find out that there's no fixed date for payroll as well.

11597,11597,,Circles.Life,30/4/2019,Wouldn't recommend this as a place to work,1.0,"Pros: This is no doubt a very ambitious company. They truly focus on- and deliver what customers need. Management is also very performance-focused, but maybe too much (more on that later), there are some very smart and hardworking people in the company. Unfortunately, my experience working here had more cons than it did pros.. Cons: Lacking transparency - They claim to have transparency in the form of sharing business results/performance goals/roadmaps, but many important business decisions are still made behind closed doors. You hear of/see new ""business partners/consultants etc"" joining the current team with no proper introductions made, and Management only addresses these when people start asking questions/express unhappiness. Reactive, not proactive. Feedback - Don't know if they still do it now but the co-Founders held ""open door sessions"" and encouraged employees to come in and give honest feedback. Pure lip service. They listen to reply, not to understand; most of the time are very defensive, making excuses, and not committing to change things at all. This behaviour was also present in the HR leadership then. Poor management culture - You'll see many other reviews here talking about their miserable management culture. (Applies to majority of Managers, not all) Extremely focused on results, yet they don't celebrate how we get there. Minimal appreciation for team members; once you reach your goal/target, another is put in front of you for immediate action. This is not wrong at all, but without proper and SINCERE appreciation shown, it's bad for employee motivation. Micromanagement is experienced by MANY teams, which trickles from the co-founders themselves. They also seem to think monetary rewards = employee motivation, which brings me to my next point.. Inadequate HR leaders - The leader(s) in the HR team (or as they call it internally : ""People & Culture"") need to seriously rethink their understanding of employee motivation and building a positive workplace culture. High level of unhappiness and turnover, overall workplace culture is not ideal, some senior employees bully the junior folks, yet HR doesn't do anything when these are reported. Also, I can say for a fact that most of the positive reviews here are indeed ""planted"", and were arranged by HR themselves. There are people hired into the company because of connections with Founders, without any formal selection process, and HR just goes ahead with no (or minimal) objections. I do wanna point out that this team has grown considerably large and pulled in a few new talents in lead positions. Hopefully this is for the better... As mentioned by a few others here, this place has a disproportionate focus on growth/profit, over employees. Understandable in a high-growth startup, but that doesn't mean you ignore employee morale and feedback. Turnover is not an issue to management, they have the mindset that people are very easily replaceable. I mentioned before that this is an ambitious company, but it borders a lot of times on being arrogant/obnoxious. Management consistently boasts about how the company is ""more than a telco"", and puts themselves in the ranks of Grab, Gojek (in terms of their success in Indonesia) but honestly they haven't really developed that much as anything more than just a telco. And with this same arrogance, they assume people are dying to join the company, but at the same time not offering competitive packages at all. Office location is also simply not attractive, but again, Management sees this as a non-issue in attracting talent. They really need a serious reality check. (If you've seen their latest Marketing stunt on the papers in Apr 2019, dissing their competitors in such an unprofessional way, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say they're obnoxious) Overall, from a consumer POV, Circles.Life is a top contender.

Everyone can relate to the problem and sympathise with each other.. Cons: Please don't join this company if you're a software engineer. This company is the ideal workplace for managers who don't care about the engineering culture and think of engineers as just some cheap labour. That is why they are always after hiring cheap Engineers from the Indian subcontinent or very pathetic service companies. There idea is that if they can get all engineers from a poorer background and dependent on visas then they'll be able to oppress the engineers. The job is 99% production support and 1% building features on top of the worst codebase anyone can see in their whole lives. You'll get frustrated to your core. The technical management has zero technical skills and think they can run a team of software engineers but just oppressing and old school management techniques. It's really disgraceful. If you value software engineering even 1% then don't join this company. Don't fall in their trap. They keep saying that the situation will improve but it has only gotten worse every day for the past year.

Cons: - No respect for time. They own your evenings. ""Lunch break"" is mere formality because it is not properly observed. If they want you to join a sudden meeting at 12:35pm, you join. You could be literally starving but it's not their problem. - Also about time, expect some colleagues to think like your life revolves on them alone and you have no one else to deal with. Their demands are heavy for very little time given to you. (to be fair, some are quite understanding) - If you are new to your job, they don't care. There's no such thing as margin for error. When it comes to maths, forecasts, and numbers, it's either you get a number right to the hundredths decimal or you are a failure at your job. Not to mention there is ZERO support or mentorship to begin with. I was my own mentor and simply learned off mistakes. I learned everything the hard way. - One minute they say ""we don't want you to be overburdened"", then later on they give you the opposite what they say - Most of the people interactions I had was when I'd be dumped some work to do or I'd be told ""how could you do this terribly wrong"", i.e. being off by 0.002% in my number forecasts. - Weird org structure. Your role can be technical in nature but be in a department/team where everyone else is non-technical. Hence, the lack of mentorship/guidance and support system, I suppose. This company scarred me and destroyed my confidence in myself. I wish I never joined Circles. I've been to terrible companies before Circles but this company is something else.

Cons: 1) Company has a lost vision 2) Peers are pretty much average from local colleges 3) The biggest issue with this company is the senior management. They can fire you anyday without giving any prior notice or warning. They will take you to a meeting room and will ask to submit your laptop and leave immediately. Such is the unprofessional behaviour of the management. And it was happening for people from entry level to Director level. 4) I was part of the Bengaluru office which had about 35 employees when I joined. During my tenure of 3 months, I saw about 10 people quitting themselves and 15 people getting fired. I was not any of the fired ones, but I quit myself seeing the unstable nature of this company. Nobody was sure what is going to happen next. 5) During my tenure I also saw office boys and talent acquisition people getting fired. It was like nobody was spared. 6) Looks like they were planning to close off the Bengaluru office, but the way it was done was terrible. 7) All this started happening after the new CTO joined the company. Any questions related to firing were termed as organisational changes. Really a bad CTO from my perspective. 8) Overall they had a very buggy system in place, where even monthly bills of customers had huge errors reported every month.",Senior Software Engineer,Bangalore,reviews,subjective,negative,

My team respected work-life balance and helps each other out with on-call events even during weekends or holidays. Team also respected the fact that members are scattered across countries. 2. That’s about it.. Cons: 1. Other departments in SG office seem to not care about demographics of other countries and appear to believe that what succeeded in SG will “surely” succeed in other countries. 2. Lack of information sharing between teams, sometimes even among team members, where as long as you weren’t in SG office, you were considered as “must comply by all or any means.” Often creating last-minute requests and calling said requests as “urgent.” Mind you, this didn’t happen in my team but has happened to another colleague in another team. 3. High-level management sets up SLA for alerts then creates alert policies that are shorter than said SLAs, thus showing lower MTTA numbers. 4. Some managers, when asked questions or criticized in monthly town halls, choose to give light answers or ignore the questions entirely. 5. Axed the people who helped launched locally in TW and AU, then called them redundant. Hey, at least show them the gratitude they deserve for helping Circles.Life come “The first international telco.” 6.

If you can shout out loud and show off, then great opportunity to climb the ladder fastly.. Cons: This company has always had some immature people like recruiters sending out wrong messages in terms of salary and stocks to new joiners. Interviewers selecting overqualified people without knowing what is the role and responsibility they are hiring for etc. But from mid-September, an unprecedented downturn is going on. It all started with the sudden unexplained firing of pioners who helped set up the company in the first place. This followed by layoffs and overdoing things to do the damage control. Their sole objective is now to quantify profits in every aspect with zero people management skills. This quantification is so much so that they even quantified bonuses and appraisals breaking clauses in offer letters which guaranteed a minimum bonus, which is illegal and the company deserves to be sued for this. What they don't realize is this can create a hostile environment as people can start firefighting to gain promotions and appraisal by hook or crook. With people being let go, credits for work not being given if their work doesn't seem to contribute to the company's profit. A lot of people feel beaten down, cornered and uncertain about what is the next turn going to be. Amidst all these, they are still punting it back to the employees calling it ""If you don't believe in leadership then you are not the right fit"". Leadership has no clue how to uplift the morale of the employees lacks empathy. They want people to completely surrender and suck up to the management and make them feel miserable so that they can be easily controlled or rather enslaved. Nobody is happy with newly appointed leaders who have made everything about themselves(some happy people are either naive or also among those who lack empathy, very few in number ), crushing everyone on their way, they are on spree to weed out every possible threat to secure their job.
