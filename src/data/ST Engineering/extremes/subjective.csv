These go both ways, if you are lucky, you will get a Reporting Officer (RO) who doesn't care about you, Hence, no micromanagement.. Cons: 1. Senior management have the mentality of ""My ideas always worked before"" and ""I know what the customers truly wants"" attitudes, does not listen to any of the actual employees that are working on the ground. 2. Salary is not competitive versus the market. 3. As a senior staff, you are expected to hold appointments in 3-4 projects at one time. The management will tasked the existing staff to take over any ""leftovers"" from the ones who left without the intention of hiring more manpower to reduce workload. 4. The management expects you to be overworked as it is common in the company and does not believe in giving you a better ""salary package"". 5. The management also does not believe in providing opportunities for the junior staff unless they are scholars. So if you are not ""first class honours"", progression will be real slow for you even if you met your KPIs. That being said, don't expect a super fast progression if you are first class. 6. Not really a major con but bosses like to come in 5-10 mins before your work day ends for meetings, so those rushing to fetch their kids, do note. 7. Micromanagement (only if you are that lucky enough to get an RO who is super into every single moves you made) 8. Decisions and changes from management takes about average 5-6 months to process. 9. On the ground engineers, I'm sorry but it is a fact that you won't be valued as much as those working at main office. (If you are not seen by the bosses, you are not contributing as much) 10.
