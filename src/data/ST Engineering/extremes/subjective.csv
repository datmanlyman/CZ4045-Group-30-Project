Your colleagues are probably here because they lack experience, got retrenched or are some contracted-service. No loyalty or camaraderie. A lot of layers of middle management.

Cons: Career Opportunities - If you are a tech / software professional, there is no real professional growth and promotions are based on ""beauty parade"" and not merit. Bosses do not really understand tech/software deeply enough. Compensations & Benefits - Pay is poor for tech / software professionals, as it is far below industry rates. Pay is only good for ""G Graders"" (aka super scale senior management). Culture & Values - Fractured company as it is a collection of legal entities of SMEs. Culture (for Singapore entities) is not even across, but each of them generally operate like an local SME. Senior Management - Operate in their Ivory Tower, with no sense of the ground realities.

5175,5175,,ST Engineering,11/9/2022,You deserve better,1.0,"Pros: 1. Good colleagues but it also depends the department you are working in. 2. These go both ways, if you are lucky, you will get a Reporting Officer (RO) who doesn't care about you, Hence, no micromanagement.. Cons: 1. Senior management have the mentality of ""My ideas always worked before"" and ""I know what the customers truly wants"" attitudes, does not listen to any of the actual employees that are working on the ground. 2. Salary is not competitive versus the market. 3. As a senior staff, you are expected to hold appointments in 3-4 projects at one time. The management will tasked the existing staff to take over any ""leftovers"" from the ones who left without the intention of hiring more manpower to reduce workload. 4. The management expects you to be overworked as it is common in the company and does not believe in giving you a better ""salary package"". 5. The management also does not believe in providing opportunities for the junior staff unless they are scholars. So if you are not ""first class honours"", progression will be real slow for you even if you met your KPIs. That being said, don't expect a super fast progression if you are first class. 6. Not really a major con but bosses like to come in 5-10 mins before your work day ends for meetings, so those rushing to fetch their kids, do note. 7. Micromanagement (only if you are that lucky enough to get an RO who is super into every single moves you made) 8. Decisions and changes from management takes about average 5-6 months to process. 9. On the ground engineers, I'm sorry but it is a fact that you won't be valued as much as those working at main office. (If you are not seen by the bosses, you are not contributing as much) 10.

5631,5631,,ST Engineering,14/6/2021,A technology company which is lagging behind others...,1.0,"Pros: A good place for retirement. Cons: Feedback is reference to ST Engineering Electronics (now known as Digital Systems) <> Recent reorganisation made things worse with the additional middle layer, ""mostly not inspiring"". Apart from higher overhead expenses, the additional layer resulted in unnecessary reports, multiple deadlines and lower productivity. For example, an actual deadline in June will result in having 1 or 2 intermediate deadlines in May. Moreover, there are endless requests for multiple reports for the same information. The time would be better used on analysis, strategising and productivity improvement instead of churning reports. <> If not for Covid-19, digital transformation is unlikely to take place in this ""Technology"" company. Nevertheless, there is still great resistance to invest in things like docusign, adobe sign and other similar tools to reduce the amount of paperwork + transport time/logistic costs for multiple levels of approvals. Moreover, there are still managers/supervisors who ask local participants to gather in a room to carry out conference calls with overseas participants. Why do that during covid-19 pandemic (when WFH should be default) instead of allowing every participant to join conference calls directly from home? It would have been safer + more productive (saving staff transportation time and cost). <> There is a lack of learning culture in the organisation. Training opportunities are often limited to engineers, neglecting the need to train all employees to equip them with the right skills (& tools) to improve productivity. Hence, some Corporate functions are run by staff who lack basic skills such as MS Powerpoint, Excel, or Word. Examples - Some of the staff in IT are not even able to provide basic troubleshooting to assist staff. - There are managers/supervisors who are totally handicap when their staff are on vacation (or sick leave). They are not even sure how to make simple amendments to presentation slides or calendar invites. <> After years of 'Productization' talk, nothing much has changed. - Core Business still remains as: System Integration, White Labelling and Maintenance & Support. Many staff who have drive & passion to develop 'made in SIngapore' products eventually gave up and left the company Generally, there is a low sense of urgency and resistance to try new things or grow the business out of Singapore Government and Defence. Every new idea or initiative is often seen as 'more work' + 'higher risk of failure'. People tend to avoid being involved in new ideas/initiatives and carry on with their 'business as usual'. This 'lack of drive' mindset is terrible and results in low productivity and efficiency. Examples - An opportunity where overseas customer demand for 'shorter than usual timeline': Instead of trying to work towards customer's request, the team chose not to pursue the opportunity to build a track record. - Secretaries (most, not all) will ask most junior meeting participants to manage calendar invites, venue, setting up meeting rooms and arrange overseas travel. While in other companies, Secretaries not only take care of all administrative and logistic matters (calendar invites, setting up meeting venues, arranging overseas travel, etc.) but also join meetings to take minutes wherever possible. Interestingly, the canteen is always buzzling and it is strange how these people have so much time to chit-chat. Confidential discussions (among 8 or less colleagues) often ended up as an open secret. Many staff lack the maturity to keep confidential information to themselves and instead use it to boast that they know a lot. <> The frequent influx of military people into the company may not be wise. The company is not recruiting the best people from the market with the right skills for the job. It will not change the perception that the company is just a 2nd career for ex-military personnel. Moreover, it will make it difficult to change the deep-seeded culture in the company. The ""Force"" is strong with this company.
