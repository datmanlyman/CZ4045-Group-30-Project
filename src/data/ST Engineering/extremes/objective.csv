5629,5629,ST Engineering,14/6/2021,A technology company which is lagging behind others...,1.0,"Pros: A good place for retirement. Cons: Feedback is reference to ST Engineering Electronics (now known as Digital Systems) <> Recent reorganisation made things worse with the additional middle layer, ""mostly not inspiring"". Apart from higher overhead expenses, the additional layer resulted in unnecessary reports, multiple deadlines and lower productivity. For example, an actual deadline in June will result in having 1 or 2 intermediate deadlines in May. Moreover, there are endless requests for multiple reports for the same information. The time would be better used on analysis, strategising and productivity improvement instead of churning reports. <> If not for Covid-19, digital transformation is unlikely to take place in this ""Technology"" company. Nevertheless, there is still great resistance to invest in things like docusign, adobe sign and other similar tools to reduce the amount of paperwork + transport time/logistic costs for multiple levels of approvals. Moreover, there are still managers/supervisors who ask local participants to gather in a room to carry out conference calls with overseas participants. Why do that during covid-19 pandemic (when WFH should be default) instead of allowing every participant to join conference calls directly from home? It would have been safer + more productive (saving staff transportation time and cost). <> There is a lack of learning culture in the organisation. Training opportunities are often limited to engineers, neglecting the need to train all employees to equip them with the right skills (& tools) to improve productivity. Hence, some Corporate functions are run by staff who lack basic skills such as MS Powerpoint, Excel, or Word. Examples - Some of the staff in IT are not even able to provide basic troubleshooting to assist staff. - There are managers/supervisors who are totally handicap when their staff are on vacation (or sick leave). They are not even sure how to make simple amendments to presentation slides or calendar invites. <> After years of 'Productization' talk, nothing much has changed. - Core Business still remains as: System Integration, White Labelling and Maintenance & Support. Many staff who have drive & passion to develop 'made in SIngapore' products eventually gave up and left the company Generally, there is a low sense of urgency and resistance to try new things or grow the business out of Singapore Government and Defence. Every new idea or initiative is often seen as 'more work' + 'higher risk of failure'. People tend to avoid being involved in new ideas/initiatives and carry on with their 'business as usual'. This 'lack of drive' mindset is terrible and results in low productivity and efficiency. Examples - An opportunity where overseas customer demand for 'shorter than usual timeline': Instead of trying to work towards customer's request, the team chose not to pursue the opportunity to build a track record. - Secretaries (most, not all) will ask most junior meeting participants to manage calendar invites, venue, setting up meeting rooms and arrange overseas travel. While in other companies, Secretaries not only take care of all administrative and logistic matters (calendar invites, setting up meeting venues, arranging overseas travel, etc.) but also join meetings to take minutes wherever possible. Interestingly, the canteen is always buzzling and it is strange how these people have so much time to chit-chat. Confidential discussions (among 8 or less colleagues) often ended up as an open secret. Many staff lack the maturity to keep confidential information to themselves and instead use it to boast that they know a lot. <> The frequent influx of military people into the company may not be wise. The company is not recruiting the best people from the market with the right skills for the job. It will not change the perception that the company is just a 2nd career for ex-military personnel. Moreover, it will make it difficult to change the deep-seeded culture in the company. The ""Force"" is strong with this company.
