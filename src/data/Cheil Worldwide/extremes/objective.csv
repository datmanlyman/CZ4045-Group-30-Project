Cons: They will work you into the ground, and it's all corporate-level work. Benefits are not that great, and it feels like they indirectly get mad for not being online at all hours. I worked a lot of weekends and even at times working for 4-6 weeks straight. A lot of the employees work so hard just for internal content or higher-up presentations for Samsung. The workflow process is one of the worst I've seen. On my first day there, I was immediately put to work within my first 5 minutes and told that a project needed to be done by EOD. I had no time to adjust, and now, that project is long gone and it felt like it was for nothing. There are plenty of times where teams are at the office until 2-3 AM while higher up's head out early. I remember a time where I was staying late while the head of office and CEO left to go to a baseball game, but before they left, they came in and bragged about it and also mentioned it was free. There was also another time I was struggling to take equipment inside and the CEO just walked by and offered no help and did not even acknowledge me. People bow down to him because he is supposed ""Koren Royalty"". No opportunity to grow, more of a stay in your line work environment. Hints of some racist, sexist comments made by director-level people, who happen to be white. Not much diversity, either Asian or white. Deadlines are unreasonably tight for no reason, and it seems like other teams in the company don't take others' time into consideration. A lot of the creative work is developed by people who don't have a great professional background or seem to be more business people instead of creatives. Whatever salary you are offered go ahead and break that down by 50-60 hours a week and see how much you getting paid, don't base it off 40 hours a week. 40 hours is a dream work week, but even then, the stress is too much for non-competitive pay.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,objective,positive,,,0.936,0.066720292,positive,positive

Cons: Well, how to start... - I've been ""sent home"" after discovering a member of my team was ""undermining"" me (harassment, mobbing, call it however you want) for more than 2 months: this person was literally choosing his designs over mine (instead of being a team I discovered we were competitors working on the same brief......), simply because he was more ""senior"" than me. His designs were presented to the client using my visualisation skills, without anyone ever really acknowledging it (our manager at the time was NOT a designer...) and keeping all the merits for himself. Yes, my designs were not chosen from my manager, but from my colleague (who didn't want to show me his works to not ""influence me"" while we were working but was constantly looking at mine while I developed them). When I accidentally discovered what was happening (him chosing the designs and not our manager), I went to HR and senior management. The decision was to keep him and not renew me at the end of the probation for ""not being a good fit for the work"" (I simply faced him after discovering what was happening and refused to help him anymore... and started leaving the office on time! He kept on picking his own designs and said I wasn't good... again him, not my manager!). - the other member of the team and the project manager knew what was happening, none of them moved a finger (or tried to approach me, or gave me any advice, for what matters) - the management is non-existant: my (not designer) manager was constantly insulted from my colleague (on the day I started even) and kept telling me to try to get along with him.... When I left I had to tell him how he was called and was really surprised to hear it... (a leaving present given, for once) - never left the office before 9pm - constant turnover, the good ones rarely last stay after the probation (or are freelancers looking for something else...). People who work there for long are definitely not happy and probably just lazy to find another job. - only koreans and “lickers” really ""progress"" (as if there was anything better to get into apart from a better salary...) - everyone constantly complains about his/her bosses, colleagues and the other teams. Like, everyday? - no teamwork, no enthusiasm, no creativity. There is some talent but usually leaves as soon as possible. I've never felt so bad in any other work experience, never met so many people hating their work/bosses/colleagues, never felt so sad for not being able to find not even one important thing to keep with me for the future. Sad because after 1 month I had already started looking for something else.
