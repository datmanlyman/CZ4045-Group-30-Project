165,165,166.0,Cheil Worldwide,2019-11-18,Big Brother Culture of oppression,1.0,Pros: Really nice Canteen/relaxation area and courtyard. Good location.. Cons: The strangest place I have ever worked! Very odd atmosphere. Usually totally silent in the office- can hear a pen drop the other side of the room. Strange for an agency! Nobody looks happy or has fun- everyone is incredibly stressed. Always felt like everyone was watching you and checking up on you the whole time ( because they actually were!). Cheil is almost entirely controlled by the Korean office and my team spent a considerable amount of time ‘reporting back’ on a daily basis. There was a total lack of trust in us ( from Korea) to the point we couldn’t really contribute anything and just felt like their puppets. It was very unrewarding and my team were totally demoralised. They came up with great ideas and solutions that were consistently disregarded by Korea. This was not the role I signed up to and I felt it was impossible to contribute anything positive due to this bizarre Orwellian culture of control and repression. Definitely not for me ( or anyone with half a brain or ambition.),Senior Management,"London, England",reviews,subjective,negative,en

Cons: - high level management talk over you in Korean all the time in meetings without explaining what is happening - extremely unorganised - there is this weird awkwardness borderline rivalry within the company against people from the 1st floor and 3rd floor - no creativity is manifested here, everything is spoon fed and chewed from Korea for us to swallow aka PUBLISH - a digital agency with software older than Fred Flintstone; actual hard copies of invoices are saved in files despite being a DIGITAL AGENCY - No 1-2-1 with line manager because they do not care about your growth unless you are from Korea - No one is racist there but you will feel like a victim of racism if you are not Korean - they will tell you you are incompetent and inexperienced without ever having a review with you and will promote people because they are korean ( i worked there for over a year and half and had one review to say i passed my probation that also a month later) - over 90% jobs are all contracts and they never review your contract on time unless you keep pestering them, eg; i was working with no contract for three months because no body knew how long to extend my contract for, because HR could not get hold of their employee who was my line manager. - promises to pay for your training but will give someone else the opportunity - because that someone else is Korean, for e.g; they gave Agile training to a staff who was there temporarily and was an exchange student and refused to give it to their permanent staff who wanted to grow, and this was not done discreetly. - they are very hot on mental health but apart from giving you free access to Headspace the Mediating App they don't actually implement practices to make the work space less stressful - HR and Finance team are extremely weak, unorganised, blasé and unreliable - for Digital Agency everything moves very slow - Lastly, if you are not Korean, be prepared to feel unappreciated, uncomfortable, awkward and dispensable.",Team and Project Assistant,"Southwark, England",reviews,subjective,negative,en

Cons: Many creatives work in a PC/Windows environment, which is a first for me. There can be technical roadblocks (encryption, asset embargos, no central servers, can't save to drives, security, etc.) that really hinder the work. Vacation is a bit low (4 weeks for everyone).

There is a LOT of work to be done all the time. I've experienced a lot of team mentality when it comes to work/life balance. When someone has something personal going on, the rest of the team steps up. The pay and benefits seem very fair. There is a small matching % for 401k which is better than nothing. And so far there is an excellent bonus system based off of your performance review. I feel lucky to be on a team that looks out for one another, and hope that the rest of the company takes notice of teams that are doing it right..

Cons: They will work you into the ground, and it's all corporate-level work. Benefits are not that great, and it feels like they indirectly get mad for not being online at all hours. I worked a lot of weekends and even at times working for 4-6 weeks straight. A lot of the employees work so hard just for internal content or higher-up presentations for Samsung. The workflow process is one of the worst I've seen. On my first day there, I was immediately put to work within my first 5 minutes and told that a project needed to be done by EOD. I had no time to adjust, and now, that project is long gone and it felt like it was for nothing. There are plenty of times where teams are at the office until 2-3 AM while higher up's head out early. I remember a time where I was staying late while the head of office and CEO left to go to a baseball game, but before they left, they came in and bragged about it and also mentioned it was free. There was also another time I was struggling to take equipment inside and the CEO just walked by and offered no help and did not even acknowledge me. People bow down to him because he is supposed ""Koren Royalty"". No opportunity to grow, more of a stay in your line work environment. Hints of some racist, sexist comments made by director-level people, who happen to be white. Not much diversity, either Asian or white. Deadlines are unreasonably tight for no reason, and it seems like other teams in the company don't take others' time into consideration. A lot of the creative work is developed by people who don't have a great professional background or seem to be more business people instead of creatives. Whatever salary you are offered go ahead and break that down by 50-60 hours a week and see how much you getting paid, don't base it off 40 hours a week. 40 hours is a dream work week, but even then, the stress is too much for non-competitive pay.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,negative,

During the interview, I was told that the role would be very exciting - it was the complete opposite. For a whole year, I was bored with very little to do. The manager wasn't very good at managing and much prefered to work and keep lots of things to himself. When he wasnt in, that was when everything would get thrown at me and I’d suddenly find out what was going on. I would always ask what's going on, is there anything to do but he never wanted me to know about anything. He preferred I managed myself - which was fine - but then would take credit for all the work I had done as though it was him who had initiated it. I flagged this up to management on 3 occasions and nothing was done to improve things. All they cared about was ’image’ and making sure things looked good even though nothing was ever getting done. After months of being bored and the stress of constantly trying to be involved in work became endless.

Cons: Well, how to start... - I've been ""sent home"" after discovering a member of my team was ""undermining"" me (harassment, mobbing, call it however you want) for more than 2 months: this person was literally choosing his designs over mine (instead of being a team I discovered we were competitors working on the same brief......), simply because he was more ""senior"" than me. His designs were presented to the client using my visualisation skills, without anyone ever really acknowledging it (our manager at the time was NOT a designer...) and keeping all the merits for himself. Yes, my designs were not chosen from my manager, but from my colleague (who didn't want to show me his works to not ""influence me"" while we were working but was constantly looking at mine while I developed them). When I accidentally discovered what was happening (him chosing the designs and not our manager), I went to HR and senior management. The decision was to keep him and not renew me at the end of the probation for ""not being a good fit for the work"" (I simply faced him after discovering what was happening and refused to help him anymore... and started leaving the office on time! He kept on picking his own designs and said I wasn't good... again him, not my manager!). - the other member of the team and the project manager knew what was happening, none of them moved a finger (or tried to approach me, or gave me any advice, for what matters) - the management is non-existant: my (not designer) manager was constantly insulted from my colleague (on the day I started even) and kept telling me to try to get along with him.... When I left I had to tell him how he was called and was really surprised to hear it... (a leaving present given, for once) - never left the office before 9pm - constant turnover, the good ones rarely last stay after the probation (or are freelancers looking for something else...). People who work there for long are definitely not happy and probably just lazy to find another job. - only koreans and “lickers” really ""progress"" (as if there was anything better to get into apart from a better salary...) - everyone constantly complains about his/her bosses, colleagues and the other teams. Like, everyday? - no teamwork, no enthusiasm, no creativity. There is some talent but usually leaves as soon as possible. I've never felt so bad in any other work experience, never met so many people hating their work/bosses/colleagues, never felt so sad for not being able to find not even one important thing to keep with me for the future.
