165,165,Cheil Worldwide,2019-11-18,Big Brother Culture of oppression,1.0,Pros: Really nice Canteen/relaxation area and courtyard. Good location.. Cons: The strangest place I have ever worked! Very odd atmosphere. Usually totally silent in the office- can hear a pen drop the other side of the room. Strange for an agency! Nobody looks happy or has fun- everyone is incredibly stressed. Always felt like everyone was watching you and checking up on you the whole time ( because they actually were!). Cheil is almost entirely controlled by the Korean office and my team spent a considerable amount of time ‘reporting back’ on a daily basis. There was a total lack of trust in us ( from Korea) to the point we couldn’t really contribute anything and just felt like their puppets. It was very unrewarding and my team were totally demoralised. They came up with great ideas and solutions that were consistently disregarded by Korea. This was not the role I signed up to and I felt it was impossible to contribute anything positive due to this bizarre Orwellian culture of control and repression.

actual hard copies of invoices are saved in files despite being a DIGITAL AGENCY - No 1-2-1 with line manager because they do not care about your growth unless you are from Korea - No one is racist there but you will feel like a victim of racism if you are not Korean - they will tell you you are incompetent and inexperienced without ever having a review with you and will promote people because they are korean ( i worked there for over a year and half and had one review to say i passed my probation that also a month later) - over 90% jobs are all contracts and they never review your contract on time unless you keep pestering them, eg; i was working with no contract for three months because no body knew how long to extend my contract for, because HR could not get hold of their employee who was my line manager. - promises to pay for your training but will give someone else the opportunity - because that someone else is Korean, for e.g; they gave Agile training to a staff who was there temporarily and was an exchange student and refused to give it to their permanent staff who wanted to grow, and this was not done discreetly. - they are very hot on mental health but apart from giving you free access to Headspace the Mediating App they don't actually implement practices to make the work space less stressful - HR and Finance team are extremely weak, unorganised, blasé and unreliable - for Digital Agency everything moves very slow - Lastly, if you are not Korean, be prepared to feel unappreciated, uncomfortable, awkward and dispensable.",Team and Project Assistant,"Southwark, England",reviews,subjective,negative,en,"['Pros', ':', '-', 'really', 'good', 'and', 'intelligent', 'colleagues', '-', 'tries', 'to', 'be', 'inclusive', 'and', 'integrated', '-', 'FREE', 'yoga', 'class', '-', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'free', 'time', 'at', 'work', '-', 'You', 'basically', 'work', 'for', 'Samsung', 'and', 'that', 'looks', 'very', 'impressive', 'on', 'your', 'CV', '.', 'Cons', ':', '-', 'high', 'level', 'management', 'talk', 'over', 'you', 'in', 'Korean', 'all', 'the', 'time', 'in', 'meetings', 'without', 'explaining', 'what', 'is', 'happening', '-', 'extremely', 'unorganised', '-', 'there', 'is', 'this', 'weird', 'awkwardness', 'borderline', 'rivalry', 'within', 'the', 'company', 'against', 'people', 'from', 'the', '1st', 'floor', 'and', '3rd', 'floor', '-', 'no', 'creativity', 'is', 'manifested', 'here', ',', 'everything', 'is', 'spoon', 'fed', 'and', 'chewed', 'from', 'Korea', 'for', 'us', 'to', 'swallow', 'aka', 'PUBLISH', '-', 'a', 'digital', 'agency', 'with', 'software', 'older', 'than', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', ';', 'actual', 'hard', 'copies', 'of', 'invoices', 'are', 'saved', 'in', 'files', 'despite', 'being', 'a', 'DIGITAL', 'AGENCY', '-', 'No', '1-2-', '1', 'with', 'line', 'manager', 'because', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'about', 'your', 'growth', 'unless', 'you', 'are', 'from', 'Korea', '-', 'No', 'one', 'is', 'racist', 'there', 'but', 'you', 'will', 'feel', 'like', 'a', 'victim', 'of', 'racism', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'not', 'Korean', '-', 'they', 'will', 'tell', 'you', 'you', 'are', 'incompetent', 'and', 'inexperienced', 'without', 'ever', 'having', 'a', 'review', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'will', 'promote', 'people', 'because', 'they', 'are', 'korean', '(', 'i', 'worked', 'there', 'for', 'over', 'a', 'year', 'and', 'half', 'and', 'had', 'one', 'review', 'to', 'say', 'i', 'passed', 'my', 'probation', 'that', 'also', 'a', 'month', 'later', ')', '-', 'over', '90', '%', 'jobs', 'are', 'all', 'contracts', 'and', 'they', 'never', 'review', 'your', 'contract', 'on', 'time', 'unless', 'you', 'keep', 'pestering', 'them', ',', 'eg', ';', 'i', 'was', 'working', 'with', 'no', 'contract', 'for', 'three', 'months', 'because', 'no', 'body', 'knew', 'how', 'long', 'to', 'extend', 'my', 'contract', 'for', ',', 'because', 'HR', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'hold', 'of', 'their', 'employee', 'who', 'was', 'my', 'line', 'manager', '.', '-', 'promises', 'to', 'pay', 'for', 'your', 'training', 'but', 'will', 'give', 'someone', 'else', 'the', 'opportunity', '-', 'because', 'that', 'someone', 'else', 'is', 'Korean', ',', 'for', 'e', '.', 'g', ';', 'they', 'gave', 'Agile', 'training', 'to', 'a', 'staff', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'temporarily', 'and', 'was', 'an', 'exchange', 'student', 'and', 'refused', 'to', 'give', 'it', 'to', 'their', 'permanent', 'staff', 'who', 'wanted', 'to', 'grow', ',', 'and', 'this', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'discreetly', '.', '-', 'they', 'are', 'very', 'hot', 'on', 'mental', 'health', 'but', 'apart', 'from', 'giving', 'you', 'free', 'access', 'to', 'Headspace', 'the', 'Mediating', 'App', 'they', ""don't"", 'actually', 'implement', 'practices', 'to', 'make', 'the', 'work', 'space', 'less', 'stressful', '-', 'HR', 'and', 'Finance', 'team', 'are', 'extremely', 'weak', ',', 'unorganised', ',', 'blasé', 'and', 'unreliable', '-', 'for', 'Digital', 'Agency', 'everything', 'moves', 'very', 'slow', '-', 'Lastly', ',', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'not', 'Korean', ',', 'be', 'prepared', 'to', 'feel', 'unappreciated', ',', 'uncomfortable', ',', 'awkward', 'and', 'dispensable', '.']",,,,

More people get promoted from within than in any other place I've worked. The bonus structure and health insurance are top tier. I actually got a ""wow"" when my doctor's office looked at my insurance coverage. This place will challenge you creatively, but they are upfront about that. Overall, I've been really impressed.. Cons: Many creatives work in a PC/Windows environment, which is a first for me. There can be technical roadblocks (encryption, asset embargos, no central servers, can't save to drives, security, etc.) that really hinder the work. Vacation is a bit low (4 weeks for everyone). All the usual ad agency pain points (late nights, weekend work, some crazy deadlines). That part isn't any better or worse than other places I've worked.

There is a LOT of work to be done all the time. I've experienced a lot of team mentality when it comes to work/life balance. When someone has something personal going on, the rest of the team steps up. The pay and benefits seem very fair. There is a small matching % for 401k which is better than nothing. And so far there is an excellent bonus system based off of your performance review. I feel lucky to be on a team that looks out for one another, and hope that the rest of the company takes notice of teams that are doing it right.. Cons: The company is not in Dallas, so anyone living in the city there is quite a commute.

Loads of nice places to eat and a downstairs cafe.. Cons: At Cheil, I felt very ostracized from what was going on. During the interview, I was told that the role would be very exciting - it was the complete opposite. For a whole year, I was bored with very little to do. The manager wasn't very good at managing and much prefered to work and keep lots of things to himself. When he wasnt in, that was when everything would get thrown at me and I’d suddenly find out what was going on. I would always ask what's going on, is there anything to do but he never wanted me to know about anything. He preferred I managed myself - which was fine - but then would take credit for all the work I had done as though it was him who had initiated it. I flagged this up to management on 3 occasions and nothing was done to improve things. All they cared about was ’image’ and making sure things looked good even though nothing was ever getting done. After months of being bored and the stress of constantly trying to be involved in work became endless. There is also a 3rd floor and 1st floor rivalry and people from other teams don't like working together.
