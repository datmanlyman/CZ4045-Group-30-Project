The overall relocation package was worse compared to my previous company’s where I could have stayed with better perks and the country I was deployed to was a developed one. When raised through to the proper channels, I was merely told ‘too bad’ and was brushed aside.

965,965,Mapletree Investments,2017-07-17,Avoid if you can,1.0,"Pros: Pay is slightly higher, but that is probably to compensate you for the toxic culture. Cons: Think of the red tape that government sector has, and the corporate politics that the private sector has, merge the two and that’s Mapletree. The other reviews aren’t exaggerating. Generally, departments work in silos and politics is widespread here. If you choose not to play, you are likely going to end up as roadkill in the process. I will not elaborate on how toxic the culture is here since my colleagues/ex-colleagues have elaborated in detail here. What I will say is, this place is good for those who are very skilled at playing politics. This is your playground. And for those who have no choice but to join, this is my advice to you: 1. Tread with care. Yes men thrive here so do not ever question your bosses. 2. Don’t be too nice. Once you are identified as a target, you will be the punching bag that people use to release their stress. Bosses do shout at their employees here, and other department’s colleagues sometimes shout at you too. I’ve heard f-words being hurled around. Try not to take that to heart or appear like you can be easily bullied. 3. Try to become the in-crowd. If you’re not part of the in-crowd, you’re ostracized and bullied. There are a lot of single fresh graduates here and it is part of the culture to work long hours, so those with families and kids think twice and try to manage it. You may have to stay around for face-time a few times a week in order to be part of that in-crowd. 4. Improve your political skills. Somehow. 5. And most importantly, do not ever trust your boss or the people around you. You can be tossed out as the by-product of a political battle anytime. Be really really careful here. Long story short is, if you have no choice but to join, think carefully about whether it is worth it to lose your soul to this company and possibly be so damaged that you need counselling help.

For the young ones who hold ambition and drive, it will be quite a waste of time unless you have the stars aligned.. Cons: - If you are looking to make progression in your career, you are better off taking your years to another place that values it or you can just do a 'stop-over' here just for name-sake and then move on. - The department I work in is extremely stacked up. You can be stuck in a position for years and not understand why you never move up, instead there seems to be more stacking up above you. On the average if you are a performer, unless you are extremely lucky to have your stars aligned, the fastest it will take you is 3-4years to move from 1 job grade to another (note it is job grade, not position and this is also hugely dependent if you have a manager who speaks out for you and whether your level is flooded with new hires). If you are a lady and you decide to go for maternity leave, you start from zero when you return. Unfortunately, the mass 80% of us are not considered as performers. As the top performers leave, those who are left behind are just those who have accepted that this is a job not a career. - New hires are always of a lower caliber. No opportunities given to existing staff as management thinks existing staff have stagnated (not because there is a motivation issue to address) and they need new blood. Interestingly 'new blood' do not tend to want to stay long so the same cycle keeps happening. - There is no room for progression and management does not bother about development of their staff. There is no culture of mentoring and training is not targeted to what the staff needs. They will do blanket training just to tick off the box that training has been provided. If you choose not to attend, there is no budget for anything else you will want to do. Training budget is an unrealistic figure which HR will estimate based on historical trends. You will see this budget go nowhere because it will never be reflective of development needs. - This is a company with little direction (or perhaps there is but most of us at ground level will never know).

Cons: Lots of backstabbing and politicking here with everyone trying to bootlick senior management for promotion/ gettin into bosses good books Plenty of overtime with pathetic meal allowance of 6 dollars max per claim (only entitled when u submit ur receipts so if u dont claim, u lose out) and tight timelines to follow through Leaving at 6pm is near impossible and if u do, ure a very special specie Some very rude and undiplomatic staff especially senior level from the HR team who talks with lack of tact, not compassionate and extremely slow to deliver Too many SOPs to follow and management does not seem willing to change because you have to adapt to their working style and environment and not the other way round Things moves very slowly here which is extremely ridiculous especially in such big organisation, memos/forms/urgent approvals takes days and days to sign and may even come back with plenty of amendments and would already exceeded timeline, management got no sense of urgency Be prepared for a huge culture shock!!

Cons: Low morale amongst staff due to high turnover rate. Management dont seem to be concern about retaining staff. Its important to select a powerful boss to join as the staff of the weaker bosses will be trampled on. There are HODs that even sacrifice their staff to please others to get brownie points. Beware of Jekyll and Hyde personalities where they practise managing upwards , winning best acting awards but are a total tyrant to their staff and peers. To survive, you will not only need brains but also the flexibility to swallow your dignity . To succeed, you will need to play the game and evolve into a master of office politics.

13663,13663,Mapletree Investments,20/8/2015,Its All Just Business,1.0,"Pros: These are only positive things I observed during my stay: 1) Higher than average bonus payout in the market. 2) Very well equipped with work equipment/tools and welfare facilities. 3) Good benefits and compensation package.. Cons: There are even more cons weighing down the pros, so do make a careful and wise decision before joining. Just ask around your friends and get some insight of the department you will be joining. 1) Slave driver company - The high bonus payout is literally masking as a carrot to compensate one for the extremely and/or ridiculously long hours. Overtime is a norm, may not appear so to all department, but it happens in most. Some departments worked an average of 12hours per day with no lull period to look forward to. Seriously, there are firms outside paying similar bonus but with reasonable hours. Do remember that money can never buy intangible things, such as time with family and friends. 2) Expectations - Provision of relevant tools and facilities does not equate to their generosity. It is an equivalent trade of their expectation of you to perform your duties promptly. For example, they provide a laptop and you will be very much expected to read and/or reply emails after office hours and over the weekend. Of course you can ignore working over weekends, but you will realize the load of backlog when you check your emails on the next working day. 3) Culture - Its a harsh environment, more than 70 percent of the employees are just rushing to put themselves in good books of their superior, and sad to say, at the expense of their own hours or their subordinates. These rush-and-hush can lead to abortive work, and I have to remind you, these are ad-hoc assignments on top of already heavy, backlog, no-lull-period workload. If you are entering at the most junior position with no one to delegate the work to... You can give this place a pass or you will be burning long hours. 4) No empathy (at all) - Its a norm for organization wants you to voice out if you cannot manage. Yes, we will, and usually they will provide lips service saying they hear us, with nothing done later. Well, do not expect any dog-patting-consoling-message here. Cause - It is All Just Business. If you cannot take the heat and raised your hands, you are likely to be told that the high bonus is exactly why you are expected to work such long hours, plus, you will be branded/marked thereafter. To them, the door is always there, you can walk out anytime if you cannot compete in their race for billions. There will, and always be, someone who is suitable for their rat race. 5) Training/Guidance/Coaching - Slow, no, zero. Training comes very slow, you are already 3months into the job when you realize an email requesting you to sign up to go understand more about the organization structure. Well, you probably already at least 60 percent familiar with the organization and/or you may not even have time to attend training. You may be thinking your superiors and peers may already guide/coach you along. Think again, and look at what was mentioned in point no.3, no one can be bothered with you. 6) Arduous start (and also on-going) - The I.T. department is a surprisingly fast working bunch who would set up your email right after you signed the appointment letter. The earlier you sign, the earlier your email account is set, and the earlier worked are and can be assigned to you by your sick superiors and peers whom cannot wait to lighten their own workload. So imagine opening your email on your first working day and realize over 50 emails of backlog work assigned to your when you were still serving your notice in previous company. If you think the people has empathy to understand? Then you should refer to point no.4. And if you think anyone is patient to guide you? See point no.5. You are on yourself. 7) Value of work - Every company has paper work, none can entirely alleviate from it. But an enormity of your hours spent here are on plain administrative paper work. In fact, even more, than most statutory board. This boils down to the value of the work you are doing, are you doing/learning something useful? Are you gaining valuable experience from those paper work? Even if you are ok, for now, are you going to work 4-5years doing all these time and time again? Alright, lets say you really endured a good 5years. During your next job interview elsewhere, what are you going to sell about your experience and value of work you have done there? So if you are looking for a job to stay long term and gain valuable experience, you can give this place a miss. 8) High Turnover - Needless to say with the aforesaid, I was also amongst the casualties that contributed to the high turnover. It is not a matter of perseverance, it is a matter of worth. When you start weighing all aspects of your life with this job (i.e.Career progression, family work life balance, money, knowledge and experience gained etc.), you will realize that there is nothing much that the company can offer you except for money. If you are an aggressive, out-of-the-world career minded person who can deny the need for any of point no.1 to 7, then you are cut for their job/work.",Executive,Singapore,reviews,subjective,positive,,,0.9944,0.118069796,positive,positive

13680,13680,Mapletree Investments,4/6/2014,"Stable company, poor culture, decent pay",1.0,"Pros: 1. Company is growing, so there are opportunities for advancement. However, most of the overseas postings can be quite tough, with little support from HQ and high (and sometimes unrealistic) expectations. 2. Pay is decent, some good performers do very well with high bonuses and promotions. You will sacrifice your work-life balance, your sleep, your health and be stressed out. 3. There should still be at least 1 - 2 IPOs left, so staff can buy shares set aside for them. (subject to quota at market rate). 4. The work itself can be interesting, and can be a good place to learn a lot if you have the right attitude AND have the right boss + colleagues. 5. General direction of the company strategy is sound, no need to worry that company will collapse or go bankrupt, just a matter of how well it does.. Cons: 1. A lot of politics in some departments. 2. Some bosses are really poor. Common complaints heard around the water cooler include small-mindedness, uncaring, (overly) demanding, and some even ""throw employees under the bus"". But not all are like that, you have a few that are outstanding. Some others who are nice people also are too tired to care. In short, culture isn't very good, and senior management is not inspiring. Patchy quality of middle management. 3. A lot of red tape. A LOT. 4. Excessive ""strength"" in internal audit/ finance dept, which makes things difficult operationally. 5.
