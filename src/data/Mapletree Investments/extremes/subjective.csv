Cons: Thinking this is a reputable company I accepted this offer, after being out stationed for some years, with a substantial pay cut to be locally based with my family. This was clearly stated during the interview. A few weeks in, I was told to relocate to a developing country as many staff there had resigned. The overall relocation package was worse compared to my previous company’s where I could have stayed with better perks and the country I was deployed to was a developed one. When raised through to the proper channels, I was merely told ‘too bad’ and was brushed aside. Many meetings are long and unproductive with zero outcomes, projects get stalled due to fear of committing a direction and decision. Decision makers in high positions are young and inexperienced, and have no clue what to do making much work abortive and staff running round in circles.",Manager,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,en

965,965,980.0,Mapletree Investments,2017-07-17,Avoid if you can,1.0,"Pros: Pay is slightly higher, but that is probably to compensate you for the toxic culture. Cons: Think of the red tape that government sector has, and the corporate politics that the private sector has, merge the two and that’s Mapletree. The other reviews aren’t exaggerating. Generally, departments work in silos and politics is widespread here. If you choose not to play, you are likely going to end up as roadkill in the process. I will not elaborate on how toxic the culture is here since my colleagues/ex-colleagues have elaborated in detail here. What I will say is, this place is good for those who are very skilled at playing politics. This is your playground. And for those who have no choice but to join, this is my advice to you: 1. Tread with care. Yes men thrive here so do not ever question your bosses. 2. Don’t be too nice. Once you are identified as a target, you will be the punching bag that people use to release their stress. Bosses do shout at their employees here, and other department’s colleagues sometimes shout at you too. I’ve heard f-words being hurled around. Try not to take that to heart or appear like you can be easily bullied. 3. Try to become the in-crowd. If you’re not part of the in-crowd, you’re ostracized and bullied. There are a lot of single fresh graduates here and it is part of the culture to work long hours, so those with families and kids think twice and try to manage it. You may have to stay around for face-time a few times a week in order to be part of that in-crowd. 4. Improve your political skills. Somehow. 5. And most importantly, do not ever trust your boss or the people around you. You can be tossed out as the by-product of a political battle anytime. Be really really careful here. Long story short is, if you have no choice but to join, think carefully about whether it is worth it to lose your soul to this company and possibly be so damaged that you need counselling help.

For the young ones who hold ambition and drive, it will be quite a waste of time unless you have the stars aligned.. Cons: - If you are looking to make progression in your career, you are better off taking your years to another place that values it or you can just do a 'stop-over' here just for name-sake and then move on. - The department I work in is extremely stacked up. You can be stuck in a position for years and not understand why you never move up, instead there seems to be more stacking up above you. On the average if you are a performer, unless you are extremely lucky to have your stars aligned, the fastest it will take you is 3-4years to move from 1 job grade to another (note it is job grade, not position and this is also hugely dependent if you have a manager who speaks out for you and whether your level is flooded with new hires). If you are a lady and you decide to go for maternity leave, you start from zero when you return. Unfortunately, the mass 80% of us are not considered as performers. As the top performers leave, those who are left behind are just those who have accepted that this is a job not a career. - New hires are always of a lower caliber. No opportunities given to existing staff as management thinks existing staff have stagnated (not because there is a motivation issue to address) and they need new blood. Interestingly 'new blood' do not tend to want to stay long so the same cycle keeps happening. - There is no room for progression and management does not bother about development of their staff. There is no culture of mentoring and training is not targeted to what the staff needs. They will do blanket training just to tick off the box that training has been provided. If you choose not to attend, there is no budget for anything else you will want to do. Training budget is an unrealistic figure which HR will estimate based on historical trends. You will see this budget go nowhere because it will never be reflective of development needs. - This is a company with little direction (or perhaps there is but most of us at ground level will never know).

To make things worse, the middle management is not receptive to feedback despite all the facts were presented. 3. The culture is top down whereby the middle management often threaten subordinates with the senior management for us to comply with no questions raised. 3. There is no work recognition. The senior manager claims all the credits and only cares about her own KPI, at the expense of the sabotaging and overloading with unethical practices and unproductive work that affect team morale. 4.

This causes alot of needless gossiping in the opaque environment. The only time you will have a staff communication is the yearly affair of telling you when you will receive your bonus.

13665,13665,,Mapletree Investments,20/8/2015,Its All Just Business,1.0,"Pros: These are only positive things I observed during my stay: 1) Higher than average bonus payout in the market. 2) Very well equipped with work equipment/tools and welfare facilities. 3) Good benefits and compensation package.. Cons: There are even more cons weighing down the pros, so do make a careful and wise decision before joining. Just ask around your friends and get some insight of the department you will be joining. 1) Slave driver company - The high bonus payout is literally masking as a carrot to compensate one for the extremely and/or ridiculously long hours. Overtime is a norm, may not appear so to all department, but it happens in most. Some departments worked an average of 12hours per day with no lull period to look forward to. Seriously, there are firms outside paying similar bonus but with reasonable hours. Do remember that money can never buy intangible things, such as time with family and friends. 2) Expectations - Provision of relevant tools and facilities does not equate to their generosity. It is an equivalent trade of their expectation of you to perform your duties promptly. For example, they provide a laptop and you will be very much expected to read and/or reply emails after office hours and over the weekend. Of course you can ignore working over weekends, but you will realize the load of backlog when you check your emails on the next working day. 3) Culture - Its a harsh environment, more than 70 percent of the employees are just rushing to put themselves in good books of their superior, and sad to say, at the expense of their own hours or their subordinates. These rush-and-hush can lead to abortive work, and I have to remind you, these are ad-hoc assignments on top of already heavy, backlog, no-lull-period workload. If you are entering at the most junior position with no one to delegate the work to... You can give this place a pass or you will be burning long hours. 4) No empathy (at all) - Its a norm for organization wants you to voice out if you cannot manage. Yes, we will, and usually they will provide lips service saying they hear us, with nothing done later. Well, do not expect any dog-patting-consoling-message here. Cause - It is All Just Business. If you cannot take the heat and raised your hands, you are likely to be told that the high bonus is exactly why you are expected to work such long hours, plus, you will be branded/marked thereafter. To them, the door is always there, you can walk out anytime if you cannot compete in their race for billions. There will, and always be, someone who is suitable for their rat race. 5) Training/Guidance/Coaching - Slow, no, zero. Training comes very slow, you are already 3months into the job when you realize an email requesting you to sign up to go understand more about the organization structure. Well, you probably already at least 60 percent familiar with the organization and/or you may not even have time to attend training. You may be thinking your superiors and peers may already guide/coach you along. Think again, and look at what was mentioned in point no.3, no one can be bothered with you. 6) Arduous start (and also on-going) - The I.T. department is a surprisingly fast working bunch who would set up your email right after you signed the appointment letter. The earlier you sign, the earlier your email account is set, and the earlier worked are and can be assigned to you by your sick superiors and peers whom cannot wait to lighten their own workload. So imagine opening your email on your first working day and realize over 50 emails of backlog work assigned to your when you were still serving your notice in previous company. If you think the people has empathy to understand? Then you should refer to point no.4. And if you think anyone is patient to guide you? See point no.5. You are on yourself. 7) Value of work - Every company has paper work, none can entirely alleviate from it. But an enormity of your hours spent here are on plain administrative paper work. In fact, even more, than most statutory board. This boils down to the value of the work you are doing, are you doing/learning something useful? Are you gaining valuable experience from those paper work? Even if you are ok, for now, are you going to work 4-5years doing all these time and time again? Alright, lets say you really endured a good 5years. During your next job interview elsewhere, what are you going to sell about your experience and value of work you have done there? So if you are looking for a job to stay long term and gain valuable experience, you can give this place a miss. 8) High Turnover - Needless to say with the aforesaid, I was also amongst the casualties that contributed to the high turnover. It is not a matter of perseverance, it is a matter of worth. When you start weighing all aspects of your life with this job (i.e.Career progression, family work life balance, money, knowledge and experience gained etc.), you will realize that there is nothing much that the company can offer you except for money. If you are an aggressive, out-of-the-world career minded person who can deny the need for any of point no.1 to 7, then you are cut for their job/work.",Executive,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,

Cons: Politically-charged culture. Everyone is nice to everyone else, but the masks are apparent everywhere. Processes literally kills. To get an approval for something involves extreme patience, perseverance, a full volume of hair (for tearing out), and loss of soul. After a while, everyone gets sucked in and ideas just die a natural death because it doesn't pay to do (or say) something different. To get anything approved, an approval paper needs to be written and typically spans tens of pages, at least 8 drafts, a minimum of 4 or 5 approvers, and a huge ""throw-back"" process where you start again from the drawing board after jumping through hoops and selling a month of fake smiles, you realise that the 5th approver did not like something written or suggested in Page 4, Paragraph 38 and it trickles down back to you after getting a earful from the afore-mentioned 4 approvers. Sa-Mu-La with a full load of eggs on your face. Top-heavy. Highest turnover is at the bottom rug, where people do most of the work. The top does most of the talking, and the talking never culminates with a specific strategy, so the working level is left confused, disoriented, and takes the blame for wrong execution of a non-concurrence in direction. The blame-game culture and the ""ivory tower"" concept holds very true here. The working level toils with daily guess-work while the Head level continues to smile at each other and goes for ""friendly"" lunches. Too much respect for rank.

Unless you are super desperate for $$$ then this will be the best job for you.. Cons: No basic respect for staff...everyday go office in fear and dunno when will get lectured or insulted.

13682,13682,,Mapletree Investments,4/6/2014,"Stable company, poor culture, decent pay",1.0,"Pros: 1. Company is growing, so there are opportunities for advancement. However, most of the overseas postings can be quite tough, with little support from HQ and high (and sometimes unrealistic) expectations. 2. Pay is decent, some good performers do very well with high bonuses and promotions. You will sacrifice your work-life balance, your sleep, your health and be stressed out. 3. There should still be at least 1 - 2 IPOs left, so staff can buy shares set aside for them. (subject to quota at market rate). 4. The work itself can be interesting, and can be a good place to learn a lot if you have the right attitude AND have the right boss + colleagues. 5. General direction of the company strategy is sound, no need to worry that company will collapse or go bankrupt, just a matter of how well it does.. Cons: 1. A lot of politics in some departments. 2. Some bosses are really poor. Common complaints heard around the water cooler include small-mindedness, uncaring, (overly) demanding, and some even ""throw employees under the bus"". But not all are like that, you have a few that are outstanding. Some others who are nice people also are too tired to care. In short, culture isn't very good, and senior management is not inspiring. Patchy quality of middle management. 3. A lot of red tape. A LOT. 4. Excessive ""strength"" in internal audit/ finance dept, which makes things difficult operationally. 5. A lot of staff are sapped, stressed out and unhappy. Company turnover is considered high.",Manager,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,

13710,13710,,Mapletree Investments,17/6/2021,Keep looking,1.0,"Pros: You have income as opposed to unemployment.. Cons: In my opinion there is no life-work balance, huge organisational chaos, really high turnover, meaning that the people you work with either just started or are about to leave or due to whatever reasons have no other options in life and just exist in great unhappiness. The systems leave you work even longer hours than you would expect because you wait and wait for files to open or close. There is no automation you would expect from a company in 21st century. It felt truly hopeless to work there because it seems like this is how the company works and management truly does not see or care how its employees are frustrated, demotivated and overworked.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,negative,

Below the market salary - don't be fooled by this ""bonus"" , you get a low base salary and they try justify it with a bonus. Boys clubs - men will only hire other men and grow their circle Toxic culture - Don't even think twice about working for a Singaporean company, it will really kill your soul. They speak highly of being a 60 billion dollar company but don't want to spend money on employee benefits. Processes within processes within processes and approvals and more approvals.

13722,13722,,Mapletree Investments,4/3/2020,A great place to work ; but unfortunately managed by the wrong set of people.,1.0,"Pros: I was almost fresh out of college when I joined Mapletree - India and not very adept with the various nuances of a corporate atmosphere. It would be very remiss of me to not acknowledge all the support , learning and experience I have gained from the organization under the former country head - India : Mr Balaji Aiyer. Extremely grateful for having a boss who is an excellent mentor and leader. It was an exciting period to see so much of action at work. I was happy despite my boss asking me to work on some weekends. Work was fun.. Cons: 1.After the exit of the former country head-India, the organization has been ineffective in utilizing the available resource bandwidth. There was no progress , workplace seemed to be in a long sleep mode and a result Mapletree had no positive news to share on India. 2.Extremely toxic working environment 3.Employee-HR engagement ranges from very slim to zero and as a result most of the issues go unaddressed 4.Senior level employees are seldom respectful towards junior level staff and often try to muscle in authority to look down upon them. 5.Extremely flaky HR policy. 6.HR should emphasis more towards ensuring a safe work place for women employees and must take adequate measure to discipline anyone found guilty of misconduct. 7.There should be more opportunities for learning and development and employees should be given the opportunity to move to other teams upon receiving prior training and subsequent evaluations.",,"Tampa, FL",reviews,subjective,negative,
13727,13727,,Mapletree Investments,24/3/2019,Toxic Internal Audit Department,1.0,"Pros: No reason to join. Any other companies' IA is definitely more advanced in working style and less toxic.. Cons: - Toxic working environment. Backstabbing and gossiping of the team by the 2 male staff (Manager and VP) is rampant. And doesn't help when such behaviour is being condoned (due to favouritism towards male). Whatever work / personal remarks made (even during lunch), these will be reported upwards. - Lack of technical knowledge. Risk and control concept is weak amongst the leaders in the department. Old school way of auditing, where most of the time you are checking if there are sign-offs only. The use of data analytics is almost non-existent. Audit issues are weak. - Backward working style. Everything is via hard copy, you are expected to photocopy every single document you review for all your audit samples. Micromanagement and lack of trust, all emails are to be vetted at least once (sometimes twice) before it can be sent out. - Working late is deemed as hardworking. Even without much to do, male staff will act busy and boast about how late he worked, and send emails past midnight.",Anonymous Employee,,reviews,subjective,negative,

13736,13736,,Mapletree Investments,13/2/2017,Chaotic and toxic environment,1.0,"Pros: Strong capital base, never short of capital due to its parentage. Overall, a professionally managed company and process driven. Good training platform for junior staff if one wants to learn how corporate process look like in an extreme sense. Cons: Generally a managed by a ""dictator"". All staff generally try to please just one person. The top guy allows, does not discourage or to a certain extend, encourages political fights among the different persons. A few members of the senior management at the HQ level that covers functions for the entire group across the world are known to create troubles for everyone. Rather than finding solutions, they generally either identify things that aren't so-called perfect (could come from local regulatory problems or different business view) and claim the local teams to be idiots, or make decision solely based on their experience without considering local constraints. They simply don't listen. Culture generally does not encourage staff to help each other out. Each staff should take sole responsibility of its project no matter how complicate it is. Company does not care about whether the right resources are put in place to support you. Incompetent leader in certain country brought in to solve problems but ultimately enlarged the problems with no visible solutions HR team works under a mission to cut costs, rather than maximizing staff's utility level with the resources they have. When negotiation for employment terms, HR is under a mentality that ""if you don't ask, I won't give"". Idiotic travel policy. Personal trip cannot be mixed with business trip. For instance, if one planned a personal trip to, say, London in 2 weeks and happen to have a last minute biz trip came up there for 2 weeks. One is required to come back (say, Singapore, the HQ), and then go to the personal trip on a plane ticket of its own. I.e., for no reason, that person need to rush back from London just to get on a flight that is personally purchased for his vacation purpose.",Vice President,,reviews,subjective,negative,

With the culture, people are afraid of making decisions, and to hide behind policies and to push the decisions to other parties. Not people oriented with excessive workload due to compliance with processes/paperwork to please different stakeholders in the company.
