To make things worse, the middle management is not receptive to feedback despite all the facts were presented. 3. The culture is top down whereby the middle management often threaten subordinates with the senior management for us to comply with no questions raised. 3. There is no work recognition. The senior manager claims all the credits and only cares about her own KPI, at the expense of the sabotaging and overloading with unethical practices and unproductive work that affect team morale. 4.

13671,13671,Mapletree Investments,17/6/2015,The Very Definition of Hierarchy,1.0,"Pros: Straightforward, no-bs retention policy - intrinsic rewards (read: HUGE BONUS) Good medical, health and leave benefits. Cons: Politically-charged culture. Everyone is nice to everyone else, but the masks are apparent everywhere. Processes literally kills. To get an approval for something involves extreme patience, perseverance, a full volume of hair (for tearing out), and loss of soul. After a while, everyone gets sucked in and ideas just die a natural death because it doesn't pay to do (or say) something different. To get anything approved, an approval paper needs to be written and typically spans tens of pages, at least 8 drafts, a minimum of 4 or 5 approvers, and a huge ""throw-back"" process where you start again from the drawing board after jumping through hoops and selling a month of fake smiles, you realise that the 5th approver did not like something written or suggested in Page 4, Paragraph 38 and it trickles down back to you after getting a earful from the afore-mentioned 4 approvers. Sa-Mu-La with a full load of eggs on your face. Top-heavy. Highest turnover is at the bottom rug, where people do most of the work. The top does most of the talking, and the talking never culminates with a specific strategy, so the working level is left confused, disoriented, and takes the blame for wrong execution of a non-concurrence in direction. The blame-game culture and the ""ivory tower"" concept holds very true here. The working level toils with daily guess-work while the Head level continues to smile at each other and goes for ""friendly"" lunches. Too much respect for rank. Plenty of fear in ""making the wrong move"", this culminates in a very stifled, non-creative, non-risk taking, finger-pointing culture.

The systems leave you work even longer hours than you would expect because you wait and wait for files to open or close. There is no automation you would expect from a company in 21st century.

Extremely grateful for having a boss who is an excellent mentor and leader. It was an exciting period to see so much of action at work. I was happy despite my boss asking me to work on some weekends. Work was fun.. Cons: 1.After the exit of the former country head-India, the organization has been ineffective in utilizing the available resource bandwidth. There was no progress , workplace seemed to be in a long sleep mode and a result Mapletree had no positive news to share on India. 2.Extremely toxic working environment 3.Employee-HR engagement ranges from very slim to zero and as a result most of the issues go unaddressed 4.Senior level employees are seldom respectful towards junior level staff and often try to muscle in authority to look down upon them. 5.Extremely flaky HR policy. 6.HR should emphasis more towards ensuring a safe work place for women employees and must take adequate measure to discipline anyone found guilty of misconduct. 7.There should be more opportunities for learning and development and employees should be given the opportunity to move to other teams upon receiving prior training and subsequent evaluations.",,"Tampa, FL",reviews,objective,positive,,,0.9873,0.183334721,positive,positive

And doesn't help when such behaviour is being condoned (due to favouritism towards male). Whatever work / personal remarks made (even during lunch), these will be reported upwards. - Lack of technical knowledge. Risk and control concept is weak amongst the leaders in the department. Old school way of auditing, where most of the time you are checking if there are sign-offs only. The use of data analytics is almost non-existent. Audit issues are weak. - Backward working style. Everything is via hard copy, you are expected to photocopy every single document you review for all your audit samples.

Overall, a professionally managed company and process driven. Good training platform for junior staff if one wants to learn how corporate process look like in an extreme sense. Cons: Generally a managed by a ""dictator"". All staff generally try to please just one person. The top guy allows, does not discourage or to a certain extend, encourages political fights among the different persons. A few members of the senior management at the HQ level that covers functions for the entire group across the world are known to create troubles for everyone. Rather than finding solutions, they generally either identify things that aren't so-called perfect (could come from local regulatory problems or different business view) and claim the local teams to be idiots, or make decision solely based on their experience without considering local constraints. They simply don't listen. Culture generally does not encourage staff to help each other out. Each staff should take sole responsibility of its project no matter how complicate it is. Company does not care about whether the right resources are put in place to support you. Incompetent leader in certain country brought in to solve problems but ultimately enlarged the problems with no visible solutions HR team works under a mission to cut costs, rather than maximizing staff's utility level with the resources they have. When negotiation for employment terms, HR is under a mentality that ""if you don't ask, I won't give"". Idiotic travel policy. Personal trip cannot be mixed with business trip. For instance, if one planned a personal trip to, say, London in 2 weeks and happen to have a last minute biz trip came up there for 2 weeks. One is required to come back (say, Singapore, the HQ), and then go to the personal trip on a plane ticket of its own.
