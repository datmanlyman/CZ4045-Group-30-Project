Cons: Panasonic Avionics is under massive investigation for fraud, bribery, falsifying facts and the department of Justice rightfully is on mission to teach them a lesson on ethics to bring them down. It wasn‚Äôt a surprise to anyone that they got away with so much corruption for years. Since 2017, the entire senior management corrupted team are fired and replaced with yet another incompetent corrupted team. Then re-org after re-org after re-org is not helping PAC to survive the mess they certainly created out of greed. The employee morale is extremely low and everyone that I know, especially key skilled individuals are leaving one after another. All the subject matter experts are gone or going to the competitors. The female managers are getting promoted unfortunately not based on their skills or experience, mostly to meet diversity. Panasonic is extremely buddy-buddy system and promotions are ONLY given to those who have a personal relationship with their upper management and suck up to management. All and all a very toxic environment with many unethical business practices and inept management. The HR is also very incompetent and an enabler to all the wrongdoings.

395,395,399.0,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,2021-04-07,Walk the walk,1.0,"Pros: Exciting industry Richly diverse teams from all over the world. Fair pay and benefits. 401K matching.. Cons: Nepotism - has been intrinsic to Panasonic Avionics‚Äô culture for decades and goes unchecked by current leadership. Ethical Fading ‚Äì led to PAC being fined $280 million by the DOJ and SEC in 2017, our CEO was exited as well as other leadership team members. Following the DOJ ruling, great strides have been made to ensure compliance with laws and policies. Very little has been discussed about ethics and the importance of ethics as it pertains to compliance. If compliance is foundational to organizational health, ethics is the ‚Äúland‚Äù where that foundation is laid. If our ethics are soft and pliable, then compliance will continue to crack and erode. Left unattended, it will fail. Lack of inclusion ‚Äì What good is diversity beyond accounting purposes if there is not an equal measure of inclusion. Sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, islamophobia, bullying, and intimidation are alive and well at PAC. Reported issues regarding exclusion are often met with responses such as ‚Äú(S)he is such a nice person! Everyone loves him/her! I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not what they meant‚Äù. Often, reports go un-responded to. Inclusion must go further than ‚ÄúInternational Women‚Äôs Day‚Äù to be fully inclusive. No Process ‚Äì Lack of process has resulted in organizational silos being built, and it has reinforced unaccountability. Blaming and finger-pointing are commonplace, with many people saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù Without process, we don‚Äôt know how well or bad we are doing. We can‚Äôt measure our efficiencies or if we are reaching our goal. This is why we are perpetually fighting fires at PAC. No strategy ‚Äì Reorgs, restructures, and layoffs are routine at Panasonic Avionics. When changes are made, it is not communicated as to what we are trying to accomplish through those changes. Lack of processes results in the inability to gauge the effectiveness of the changes. Working without strategy creates the illusion of change without anything being accomplished. Imagine a team of 3-year old‚Äôs playing soccer. Things are happening on the field, and nothing is being accomplished. The fire fighting continues. The absence of vision from leadership has contributed to the lack of process and strategy. Without a clear vision, we are not sure what we are working towards. What are we trying to accomplish at PAC? Vision provides a direction of an overarching when we know what direction we are moving in. We can set a path in that direction by monitoring and measuring success through process and feedback. Panasonic Avionics is adrift and rudderless without vision. Careless leadership ‚Äì in a recorded address to the company last June, the CEO announced that a second round of significant layoffs would be taking place that day. In the same breath, he announced our CTO‚Äôs hiring from Netflix and that we would be moving to a newly renovated campus once it was safe again. While hiring a new CTO and a new campus is exciting, announcing it in conjunction with layoffs was cruel and displayed a gross lapse in empathy, emotional intelligence, and grace. Change adverse ‚Äì Maintaining the status quo is valued and exemplified at the highest levels of leadership. In a meeting with a Vice President, an idea to create a training initiative that would support a career advancement program was brought up. Without missing a beat, the VP said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea, but that‚Äôs a paradigm shift, and we don‚Äôt have time for that.‚Äù There is a lot of talk about things that ‚Äúshould change‚Äù and ‚Äúcould make a difference,‚Äù but no action is ever taken. This adversity to change has stunted innovation at PAC. ‚ÄúInnovations‚Äù that have been touted recently at PAC should be recognized as a capitulation to market demands rather than innovation. At this point, PAC is surviving on inertia alone. There is fear to speak truth to power at PAC. In one of our last in-person all-hands meetings, an employee stood up and said that he did not have the tools and network access he needed to do his job. He was unable to correct issues that were costing significant time and money. Despite having gone through the correct channels, the employee could not gain access to the tools he needed to be successful. One of the executives on the stage roasted the employee, telling him exactly why he couldn‚Äôt get access to the tools he needed and that he would ‚Äúneed to figure it out.‚Äù At that moment, it was demonstrated by leadership that it was not safe to speak truth to power, even if it is to ask for help. More disappointing was that no other executive standing on that stage tried to intervene. This fear to speak truth to power keeps employees from asking questions, making suggestions, or even giving a complete picture or assessment of any given situation that may be less than optimal. Employees are taken for granted. The CEO and a VP announced the ‚ÄúPanasonic Avionics Excellence Awards.‚Äù The first time an award would be given to recognize the top 10 performing teams at PAC, with some impressive prizes going to the top 3 teams. The top 10 teams were announced, then the top three teams were announced, and then nothing, just silence. Hardworking and engaged teams go unappreciated regularly at PAC. We still don‚Äôt know who the winners were. Not following through on something as simple as saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is a failure of leadership and accountability at a fundamental level. Career advancement is not a straightforward process at Panasonic Avionics unless you‚Äôre well connected. Nepotism ensures that the easiest way to be promoted within the organization is through relationships. There is no guidance on what it takes to move from a level one position to a level 2 position or beyond. Most job descriptions for the different levels are the same, and the leveling is primarily based upon one‚Äôs rate of pay. Beyond that, no one understands what skill sets are necessary to move up in the organization beyond knowing the right people. Leadership refuses to listen when team members provide input. Over the past year and a half, we have been asked to provide our inputs to ‚ÄúCulture Surveys‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmployee Opinion Surveys.‚Äù Results from such surveys are either statistically incorrect, painting a rosier picture than what is taking place in actuality, or results are never shared at all. In either case, no action plans to address issues that are communicated through surveys are ever put into place, and our opinions and inputs are ignored. Asking for one‚Äôs opinion and then not acknowledging it appears disingenuous and inauthentic. It‚Äôs important to remember that leaders who refuse to listen will ultimately be surrounded by people who have nothing to say. Culture of unaccountability ‚Äì The issues that have been mentioned above point to a company with leadership that says one thing and demonstrates the opposite. Leaders have spoken publicly and eloquently about the importance of ‚ÄúGrit and Grace.‚Äù Still, grit is easily overlooked because of nepotism, and grace is absent from the highest level of leadership. Executives have spoken about the importance of mentorship in building strong leaders within an organization but have made no effort to encourage mentorship at PAC. Talks on the importance of gratitude have been given, yet leadership couldn‚Äôt be bothered to complete an effort to recognize highly engaged teams. Accountability isn‚Äôt achieved in the words that we say, but rather in the actions we take towards making those words a reality. It isn‚Äôt easy to trust and respect those who talk the talk but don‚Äôt walk the walk.",Anonymous Employee,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,en

932,932,947.0,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,2013-08-08,"An environment rife with scapegoating, misconduct, employee mistreatment, lack of reward, lack of respect",1.0,"Pros: -. Cons: Panasonic is a terrible work environment, driven solely by politics, pure and simple. If you're even considering it, I strongly suggest you contact anyone who has left there. Employees are overloaded with work, provided with unrealistic time-frames that aren't feasible or humane, and should anything go wrong they are scapegoated and vilified. Raises happen rarely, and not based on merit. Cronyism isn't just rampant, it's the norm and they act as though it's typical business practice. The negative impact of it probably creates the most problems at Panasonic, because severe errors made by management are never dealt with and get repeated while the worst of people are rewarded. The people who work the hardest never move and the salaries for engineers are capped by level. The company makes great sounding plans, then works as hard as it can to destroy the product by being careless and at the same time blaming anyone and everyone in sight. I don't know anybody there in engineering who is happy, and the people I knew who left were ecstatic. Panasonic is a corporate nightmare, with few scruples and even less interest in recognizing dedication and the value of people. I saw the same pattern for years; people were paid a half-decent wage in the beginning, had some successes while they thought it was a moderately fair place, then after relentless antagonism from management and the blame game, their spirit slowly crumbled as more unrealistic feats were expected without proper resources or recognition being provided. They were lulled into staying because of the economy and because they didn't care much about a positive work environment anymore. They lost hope. Many turned -heavily- to alcohol. They eventually became so experienced that it didn't phase them as much, but were never treated any better and never given the resources and support that would have provided them with a fair, structured, comfortable work life. Moreover, the company always made it harder and harder to get the exact same job done which made the same job increasingly more stressful. I'm leaving out a lot, but trust me, you will find out within 1.5 - 2 years time how big of a mistake you made joining Panasonic. Survival Tips (but please reconsider): If you want to survive there, you'll need to make a lot of friends in every department. If you leave a door open for them to target you/blame you/use you and have no political protection, they will do so gladly. You can work very hard and never get promoted, or just do a mediocre but not totally useless job and probably get promoted if you never make waves. If you get overloaded with work, make sure you tell your manager you need assistance or perception will be that you have a total handle on things. Do not bother with HR unless you have a legal case, they will not react. Most of all, do not be weak with Panasonic. They (management) have no interest in you or your happiness. They want you to be successful, to make their department look 100x better than other departments (it's that competitive) and overcome all the obstacles management has created without saying ""I didn't have the information"" or ""there wasn't time because this is a complex product and the schedule doesn't work"". Most people who leave Panasonic are fired with their reputations ruined, luckily this didn't happen to me, but happened to many good people I knew who (by the end) thought themselves utterly worthless, until they found a normal job that opened their eyes.",Engineer,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,en

They are willing to share knowledge. Whatever they know or whatever result of study they find out, they will put into the database and everyone is free to access it. You definitely can learn a lot of technical stuff if you are in the R&D team.. Cons: They expect you to work for long hours with very low pay. They just pay S$9 per hour for over-time and you are expected to stay back till 9pm or 10pm. The office hours is from 8am to 5.30pm. Sometimes, you are required to come during Saturday and Sunday. It is better not to come on any weekend. Once you tell that you can come on one weekend, you will be asked to come every weekend. The working hours are not that flexible. If you are late for just even 1 second, they will deduct your salary. Every morning, every one is supposed to sing the company song. Then, depending on the group you are in, some group managers expect the employees to tell what they plan to do in a day. You can't have nothing to say. If you have nothing to say, it will give bad impression to the manager (especially software group). This will affect your review. Besides, you are not expected to say the same thing every morning. If you do that, the manager will ask you when you are going to finish you job. Every Friday, you are expected to write in a weekly report, telling what you have done in the whole week. This is kind of getting monitored all the while. The so-called ""Adviser"" of the software group keeps saying that if you have doubt on something, you can seek advice from him. When you really seek advice, he will ask what you plan to do. Ridiculous, huh? If you never hear of a software general manager who doesn't know software, you can find in this company. The software so-called GM never side to the local employees. He sides Japan very much more than anything. If Japan says one thing, he dares not confront. In the end, it is the Singapore software group to suffer. One of the colleagues' wife had internal bleeding due to pregnancy, he asked for leave. The software GM disallowed him to take leave. Is this human?? Secondly, it is the management side. They keep saying that they have no money for our increment and bonus. Yet, you can see the Japanese ""Advisers"", who are stationed here, are given a car each and a condominium each to stay with their families. When some colleagues are to stationed in Singapore for a few days, they are asked to stay in a hotel which costs less than S$100 per night. You can imagine what kind of hotel that is. When some Japanese are sent to work in Singapore for a few days, they are offered 5-star hotel in the city. Can you imagine how terrible this company is. Yet, our increment is S$10 to S$30 per year. That is less than 1% of slightly more than 1%. If you compare to the inflation rate, you will become poorer and poorer as you work for many years in this company. Yet, some Japanese advisers can play the ""rich-people game"", GOLF. The software adviser, when has nothhing to do, will practise the skill in front of the employees. Besides, you are given only 2 uniforms and are expected to wear for 5 days. Terrible... They become richer and richer and you will become poorer and poorer slaves forever.

Panasonic Avionics is rated 2.6, almost an entire point lower putting the company in the bottom percentile Speaks for itself. Positive reviews are vague one-liners contrast that with negative reviews that are specific critique‚Äôs and paragraphs long. This dichotomy is an accurate reflection of the company‚Äôs culture. Some in comfortable positions are oblivious of market factors, customer complaints, and toxic culture. Those trying to effect change have to move over, around, or work harder to make up for those hanging out and getting paid. The result, frustration drives top talent out effecting a complete talent drain. If you are hoping to grow or work on challenging but rewarding projects look elsewhere. Business leaders are stuck in time warp regarding public demand for aviation connectivity. They still call their systems IFE [Inflight Entertainment] a reference to the hardware they sell, when hardware is becoming obsolete. Before applying to this company, I recommend you check out their ‚Äúofferings‚Äù page found at Panasonic.aero/our-offerings/ Airlines who are projected to take 10+ years to regain the passage volume they had in Feb 2020 are either removing these products, pulling services back in the house, or eliminating them in hopes of surviving. The passenger‚Äôs connectivity expectation in 10 years will look completely different from that of today. Panasonic Avionics business model was not to invest in R&D or innovated their offerings but to doubled down on customization, offering thousands of variations on the same product to blend in with the customers' cabin color schemes. This plethora of choice which captured a lion share of the market in the ‚Äô90s is the overhead turned millstone around their neck of today. Case and point even before COVID Panasonic Avionics had several rounds of layoffs in 2019 pre pandemic. Post pandemic their customers are fighting to meet payroll. For several years to come IFE will be nowhere in the budget discussion. The lack of innovation can be seen at all levels of the business. The perks offered, the evaluation process, promotion opportunities, the lack of training, and the leadership styles of managers. All stuck in a 1990‚Äôs mindset. Case in point up until 2019 the company had contractors on assignment for years at a time. The coworker I sat next to had been on contract for 5+ years before he was downsized at the last layoff. Shocked Panasonic Avionics hasn‚Äôt been sued. Can you say class action? Panasonic Avionics is a subsidiary of Panasonic and whole owned, meaning employees are not eligible for stock. Compensation is made up primarily of one‚Äôs base salary with a small yearly bonus that is derived on the profitability of the company as a whole. Not an individual‚Äôs contribution. Let me explain why this is a horrific situation should you join the company in hopes of growing your career. The compensation model uncouples performance and accountability at all levels of the business. Leaders are incentivized to maintain the statues vs investing in innovating for the future. And innovate is what Panasonic Avionics needed to do over the last 15 years to survive. This breeds a culture of apathy. Leadership coupled with company prospects are so bad I‚Äôm dusting off my resume and am in a full job search during the COVID lockdown. Time to get off the sinking ship.

Cons: I've never been as happy to see a company disappear in the rear-view mirror as I am with PAC. Working here has been a real low-point in my career and life due to the quality of people I was forced to follow. Management in Lake Forest is a literal joke; very few supervisors are respected and managers and directors might as well be on the moon for all they contribute to the daily grind. In the last two years, they couldn't even figure out how to fix or alleviate the awful parking and bathroom situations. In fact, every inexplicable action taken simply put more burden on workers. After removing all the cubicles and sticking employees together elbow-to-elbow at long tables, we all started catching colds and getting sick more often. (In retrospect, another preeminently bad decision by executives.) In return, raises were cancelled and cute little music videos started appearing on the internal Yammer site, claiming we were all part of one big family and promoting solidarity. It was laughable; they simply couldn't do anything right to turn the morale ship around. The recent layoffs were handled with typical inelegance; no phone calls, emails or handshakes - just a mass Teams meeting with access cut off for an encore. Panasonic tried so hard to create the illusion of a positive culture but it was like watching the Flex tape guy invite you into his boat - you just knew that the whole thing was bound to come apart sooner rather than later, driven by maniacs (or in this case, idiots). #ONETEAM",Software Development Engineer,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,

Dysfunction is ramped. Senior leaders are out of touch and not likely to be able to save the company from sinking. We were informed layoffs were likely.

Plain sad. 5) Since they hired a lot of these upper management folks with mega salaries, Christmas parties among others perks have been cut to fund them, I think. 6) Management promises certain things and doesn't fulfill them. 7) Not a good company for people who need H1-B's/GC's. New policy is no sponsorship. Even if they sponsor for certain individuals, you would have to pay them out of your pocket. So watch out, they work only with their lawyers!!

If you don't fall into the right category or know the right person, promotions and raises are extremely hard to obtain, despite qualifications.

The most immature engineering department that I have ever met in my life, filled with engineering managers who just fight with each other and develop contradicting technologies. Everything is a turf war, and they develop middle layers just for the sake of developing middle layers to control each other. Most engineering managers (except a few), are not technical enough / have the balls to facilitate technologies debates. 2. I guess this is not just the engineering department. All departments don't communicate with each other and hate each other. Sometimes the managers hate each other so much, they teach their team members to hate the members of the other team. So you are ""guilty by association"", when it's absolutely critical that the teams work together. In the end, the customer and the business suffers because of these turf wars. 3. The sad thing is that, I realized that if these managers actually communicate properly with each other, they will find that their interests are actually aligned. Poor communication creates false assumptions with results in unproductive hate of each other. 4. Management culture is toxic where favoritism trumps reasoning. 5. The are so many questionable hires at key positions, that results in the rare good employees feel like a ""slap in the face"". 6. Ok, so if you are not experienced, I would still respect you if you are willing to learn from mistakes and willing to change. However, that is not the case, there seems to be no intention to change the practice. And managers just crosses their fingers, closes their eyes, procrastinate on the problem, and hope that the problems will go away.

Panasonic is hindered by redundant paperwork and unrealistic guidelines. The Field Maintenance Report program needs serious overhaul and has been a work in progress for 5 plus years...that's not very reassuring for a technology company. The company needs to streamline its guidelines and rebrand. There is virtually no HR to work with, only a hand full of HR staff to handle thousands of employees in a North America.

This place is highly characterized by BIG favortism. the reason that some directors or managers hold their positions is that they are good freinds of VPs. It has been a well known fact that some management don't do their jobs at all. Some teams have very low moral, high turn over rates., and keeps looking for new hires to fill in the vacancies by people who quit.

Cons: too numerous too mention. Reactive not proactive company. Dreadful internal communication - in fact I would say almost non existent. Interesting way of higher senior management and therefore management is incompetent (you know who you are!!!!!). Poor work life balance. High turn over rate,PMO,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,
6747,6747,,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,22/5/2010,A Very Poor Company. With High Turnover,1.0,"Pros: Pay Check Benefits are so so. Really no better than any other company of this size. A lot of employees come from very small aviation companies that offer limited or no benefits so the Panasonic benefits package tends to look really good. This really isn't true. They are average at best. In fact 401k matching contributions were suspended for close to 1 year.. Cons: After my first month at Panasonic Avionics there were almost too many red flags to describe. I was told the company was ISO AS9100 certified, yet I couldn't find any process to speak of. As I came to find out the certification was for hardware, not software. It's been 4 years and there are still no processes in place to speak of. The lack of any process was an unbelievable cause of frustration for so many people, in other departments as well. It created VERY long hours of work and stress because you spent most of your day chasing your tail rather than doing anything productive yet you were still responsible for your deliverables. When decisions were made there was no attempt to share these with other departments. The complete lack of communication was unbelievable. All this caused a revolving door where employees usually could only take about a year and then quit. This has slowed a bit but based on the feedback I get from other people, this is more to do with the economy than anything else. After all of this I started to question the capability of management and as I looked deeper into their qualifications, there were some, let's just say ""dubious decisions"" for hiring some senior managers. One could argue that this is just one persons observations, yet Panasonic Avionics continually score extremely low on customer satisfaction scores. One very large airline continually scores Panasonic as the worst of all vendors they deal with. My suggestion is to really think long and hard about accepting a position with this company. On a recent job interview that was for a company outside of this industry, the interviewer told me that he and another manager "" had very real concerns that I came from Panasonic . We feel that you have not been provided with adequate training or have developed bad habits"". I have been asked by several friends about going to work for Panasonic. I try to be fair and list the Pros and Cons but as evident, the cons really out weigh the pros.",PMO,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,
