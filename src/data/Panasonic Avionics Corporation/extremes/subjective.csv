Cons: Panasonic Avionics is under massive investigation for fraud, bribery, falsifying facts and the department of Justice rightfully is on mission to teach them a lesson on ethics to bring them down. It wasn‚Äôt a surprise to anyone that they got away with so much corruption for years. Since 2017, the entire senior management corrupted team are fired and replaced with yet another incompetent corrupted team. Then re-org after re-org after re-org is not helping PAC to survive the mess they certainly created out of greed. The employee morale is extremely low and everyone that I know, especially key skilled individuals are leaving one after another. All the subject matter experts are gone or going to the competitors. The female managers are getting promoted unfortunately not based on their skills or experience, mostly to meet diversity. Panasonic is extremely buddy-buddy system and promotions are ONLY given to those who have a personal relationship with their upper management and suck up to management. All and all a very toxic environment with many unethical business practices and inept management. The HR is also very incompetent and an enabler to all the wrongdoings.

395,395,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,2021-04-07,Walk the walk,1.0,"Pros: Exciting industry Richly diverse teams from all over the world. Fair pay and benefits. 401K matching.. Cons: Nepotism - has been intrinsic to Panasonic Avionics‚Äô culture for decades and goes unchecked by current leadership. Ethical Fading ‚Äì led to PAC being fined $280 million by the DOJ and SEC in 2017, our CEO was exited as well as other leadership team members. Following the DOJ ruling, great strides have been made to ensure compliance with laws and policies. Very little has been discussed about ethics and the importance of ethics as it pertains to compliance. If compliance is foundational to organizational health, ethics is the ‚Äúland‚Äù where that foundation is laid. If our ethics are soft and pliable, then compliance will continue to crack and erode. Left unattended, it will fail. Lack of inclusion ‚Äì What good is diversity beyond accounting purposes if there is not an equal measure of inclusion. Sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, islamophobia, bullying, and intimidation are alive and well at PAC. Reported issues regarding exclusion are often met with responses such as ‚Äú(S)he is such a nice person! Everyone loves him/her! I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not what they meant‚Äù. Often, reports go un-responded to. Inclusion must go further than ‚ÄúInternational Women‚Äôs Day‚Äù to be fully inclusive. No Process ‚Äì Lack of process has resulted in organizational silos being built, and it has reinforced unaccountability. Blaming and finger-pointing are commonplace, with many people saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù Without process, we don‚Äôt know how well or bad we are doing. We can‚Äôt measure our efficiencies or if we are reaching our goal. This is why we are perpetually fighting fires at PAC. No strategy ‚Äì Reorgs, restructures, and layoffs are routine at Panasonic Avionics. When changes are made, it is not communicated as to what we are trying to accomplish through those changes. Lack of processes results in the inability to gauge the effectiveness of the changes. Working without strategy creates the illusion of change without anything being accomplished. Imagine a team of 3-year old‚Äôs playing soccer. Things are happening on the field, and nothing is being accomplished. The fire fighting continues. The absence of vision from leadership has contributed to the lack of process and strategy. Without a clear vision, we are not sure what we are working towards. What are we trying to accomplish at PAC? Vision provides a direction of an overarching when we know what direction we are moving in. We can set a path in that direction by monitoring and measuring success through process and feedback. Panasonic Avionics is adrift and rudderless without vision. Careless leadership ‚Äì in a recorded address to the company last June, the CEO announced that a second round of significant layoffs would be taking place that day. In the same breath, he announced our CTO‚Äôs hiring from Netflix and that we would be moving to a newly renovated campus once it was safe again. While hiring a new CTO and a new campus is exciting, announcing it in conjunction with layoffs was cruel and displayed a gross lapse in empathy, emotional intelligence, and grace. Change adverse ‚Äì Maintaining the status quo is valued and exemplified at the highest levels of leadership. In a meeting with a Vice President, an idea to create a training initiative that would support a career advancement program was brought up. Without missing a beat, the VP said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea, but that‚Äôs a paradigm shift, and we don‚Äôt have time for that.‚Äù There is a lot of talk about things that ‚Äúshould change‚Äù and ‚Äúcould make a difference,‚Äù but no action is ever taken. This adversity to change has stunted innovation at PAC. ‚ÄúInnovations‚Äù that have been touted recently at PAC should be recognized as a capitulation to market demands rather than innovation. At this point, PAC is surviving on inertia alone. There is fear to speak truth to power at PAC. In one of our last in-person all-hands meetings, an employee stood up and said that he did not have the tools and network access he needed to do his job. He was unable to correct issues that were costing significant time and money. Despite having gone through the correct channels, the employee could not gain access to the tools he needed to be successful. One of the executives on the stage roasted the employee, telling him exactly why he couldn‚Äôt get access to the tools he needed and that he would ‚Äúneed to figure it out.‚Äù At that moment, it was demonstrated by leadership that it was not safe to speak truth to power, even if it is to ask for help. More disappointing was that no other executive standing on that stage tried to intervene. This fear to speak truth to power keeps employees from asking questions, making suggestions, or even giving a complete picture or assessment of any given situation that may be less than optimal. Employees are taken for granted. The CEO and a VP announced the ‚ÄúPanasonic Avionics Excellence Awards.‚Äù The first time an award would be given to recognize the top 10 performing teams at PAC, with some impressive prizes going to the top 3 teams. The top 10 teams were announced, then the top three teams were announced, and then nothing, just silence. Hardworking and engaged teams go unappreciated regularly at PAC. We still don‚Äôt know who the winners were. Not following through on something as simple as saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is a failure of leadership and accountability at a fundamental level. Career advancement is not a straightforward process at Panasonic Avionics unless you‚Äôre well connected. Nepotism ensures that the easiest way to be promoted within the organization is through relationships. There is no guidance on what it takes to move from a level one position to a level 2 position or beyond. Most job descriptions for the different levels are the same, and the leveling is primarily based upon one‚Äôs rate of pay. Beyond that, no one understands what skill sets are necessary to move up in the organization beyond knowing the right people. Leadership refuses to listen when team members provide input. Over the past year and a half, we have been asked to provide our inputs to ‚ÄúCulture Surveys‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmployee Opinion Surveys.‚Äù Results from such surveys are either statistically incorrect, painting a rosier picture than what is taking place in actuality, or results are never shared at all. In either case, no action plans to address issues that are communicated through surveys are ever put into place, and our opinions and inputs are ignored. Asking for one‚Äôs opinion and then not acknowledging it appears disingenuous and inauthentic. It‚Äôs important to remember that leaders who refuse to listen will ultimately be surrounded by people who have nothing to say. Culture of unaccountability ‚Äì The issues that have been mentioned above point to a company with leadership that says one thing and demonstrates the opposite. Leaders have spoken publicly and eloquently about the importance of ‚ÄúGrit and Grace.‚Äù Still, grit is easily overlooked because of nepotism, and grace is absent from the highest level of leadership. Executives have spoken about the importance of mentorship in building strong leaders within an organization but have made no effort to encourage mentorship at PAC. Talks on the importance of gratitude have been given, yet leadership couldn‚Äôt be bothered to complete an effort to recognize highly engaged teams. Accountability isn‚Äôt achieved in the words that we say, but rather in the actions we take towards making those words a reality. It isn‚Äôt easy to trust and respect those who talk the talk but don‚Äôt walk the walk.",Anonymous Employee,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,subjective,negative,en,"['Pros', ':', 'Exciting', 'industry',

932,932,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,2013-08-08,"An environment rife with scapegoating, misconduct, employee mistreatment, lack of reward, lack of respect",1.0,"Pros: -. Cons: Panasonic is a terrible work environment, driven solely by politics, pure and simple. If you're even considering it, I strongly suggest you contact anyone who has left there. Employees are overloaded with work, provided with unrealistic time-frames that aren't feasible or humane, and should anything go wrong they are scapegoated and vilified. Raises happen rarely, and not based on merit. Cronyism isn't just rampant, it's the norm and they act as though it's typical business practice. The negative impact of it probably creates the most problems at Panasonic, because severe errors made by management are never dealt with and get repeated while the worst of people are rewarded. The people who work the hardest never move and the salaries for engineers are capped by level. The company makes great sounding plans, then works as hard as it can to destroy the product by being careless and at the same time blaming anyone and everyone in sight. I don't know anybody there in engineering who is happy, and the people I knew who left were ecstatic. Panasonic is a corporate nightmare, with few scruples and even less interest in recognizing dedication and the value of people. I saw the same pattern for years; people were paid a half-decent wage in the beginning, had some successes while they thought it was a moderately fair place, then after relentless antagonism from management and the blame game, their spirit slowly crumbled as more unrealistic feats were expected without proper resources or recognition being provided. They were lulled into staying because of the economy and because they didn't care much about a positive work environment anymore. They lost hope. Many turned -heavily- to alcohol. They eventually became so experienced that it didn't phase them as much, but were never treated any better and never given the resources and support that would have provided them with a fair, structured, comfortable work life. Moreover, the company always made it harder and harder to get the exact same job done which made the same job increasingly more stressful. I'm leaving out a lot, but trust me, you will find out within 1.5 - 2 years time how big of a mistake you made joining Panasonic. Survival Tips (but please reconsider): If you want to survive there, you'll need to make a lot of friends in every department. If you leave a door open for them to target you/blame you/use you and have no political protection, they will do so gladly. You can work very hard and never get promoted, or just do a mediocre but not totally useless job and probably get promoted if you never make waves. If you get overloaded with work, make sure you tell your manager you need assistance or perception will be that you have a total handle on things. Do not bother with HR unless you have a legal case, they will not react. Most of all, do not be weak with Panasonic. They (management) have no interest in you or your happiness. They want you to be successful, to make their department look 100x better than other departments (it's that competitive) and overcome all the obstacles management has created without saying ""I didn't have the information"" or ""there wasn't time because this is a complex product and the schedule doesn't work"". Most people who leave Panasonic are fired with their reputations ruined, luckily this didn't happen to me, but happened to many good people I knew who (by the end) thought themselves utterly

As long as you have worked there for sometime and know the key people you are okay. 4) All the key management folks who have been there for quite some time have been pushed out and DirectTV management folks have thronged here and they don't have a clue how to run an avionics company. Plain sad. 5) Since they hired a lot of these upper management folks with mega salaries, Christmas parties among others perks have been cut to fund them, I think. 6) Management promises certain things and doesn't fulfill them. 7) Not a good company for people who need H1-B's/GC's. New policy is no sponsorship. Even if they sponsor for certain individuals, you would have to pay them out of your pocket. So watch out, they work only with their lawyers!!

There is a hiring freeze :-) 11) No work from home option. 12) All the Panasonic culture has been destroyed, there are rumors that Panasonic might sell of Panasonic avionics and there are preparing for that? 13) In all, it was a bad taste in my mouth.

6536,6536,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,24/3/2017,Avoid this company unless all you want is a salary,1.0,"Pros: 1. Good benefits, salary and travel expense policy. Cons: 1. The most immature engineering department that I have ever met in my life, filled with engineering managers who just fight with each other and develop contradicting technologies. Everything is a turf war, and they develop middle layers just for the sake of developing middle layers to control each other. Most engineering managers (except a few), are not technical enough / have the balls to facilitate technologies debates. 2. I guess this is not just the engineering department. All departments don't communicate with each other and hate each other. Sometimes the managers hate each other so much, they teach their team members to hate the members of the other team. So you are ""guilty by association"", when it's absolutely critical that the teams work together. In the end, the customer and the business suffers because of these turf wars. 3. The sad thing is that, I realized that if these managers actually communicate properly with each other, they will find that their interests are actually aligned. Poor communication creates false assumptions with results in unproductive hate of each other. 4. Management culture is toxic where favoritism trumps reasoning. 5. The are so many questionable hires at key positions, that results in the rare good employees feel like a ""slap in the face"". 6. Ok, so if you are not experienced, I would still respect you if you are willing to learn from mistakes and willing to change. However, that is not the case, there seems to be no intention to change the practice. And managers just crosses their fingers, closes their eyes, procrastinate on the problem, and hope that the problems will go away. A key example is that managers are absolutely adamant about sticking to the ""process"", when they themselves believe that the ""process is broken / not sufficient"".
