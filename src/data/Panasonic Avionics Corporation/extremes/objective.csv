333,333,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,2015-04-10,medium-large company that encourages long term focus and is willing to take risks,5.0,"Pros: The benefits (great health insurance, very basic dental, basic vision, good 401K matching) are pretty good, much better than the industry average, the only downside is no pension, but even large companies that used to offer pensions (like Boeing) are no longer offering them to new employees. Overall the culture is good for software developers. Short term hacks that hurt in the long run are discouraged, unnecessary schedule pressure is not applied allowing developers to do quality work. A focus on continuous improvement is part of the culture and this includes occasionally throwing out old systems, and re-architecting them.. Cons: There seems to be some lack of communication across organizations. Some designs may make sense from one point of view but work less than ideally across full integrated systems. Each individual organization seems to have lots of autonomy which empowers them, but it would be nice if there was more cross organization cooperation, so the autonomy could be used more effectively.

They have no compassion to employees. The hardworking personnel are tired and sweating installing components, troubleshooting and doing modification while the managers are pretending to work woth their nonsense daily meetings. The company would save tons of money by not hiring too many lazy incompetent managers but instead hire more field licensed aircraft engineers, technicians, software developers in the engineering department.

6075,6075,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,22/8/2008,"If you have a choice, don't work for Panasonic AV Networks Singapore.",1.0,"Pros: The good reason of working in Panasonic AV Networks Singapore is that the colleagues are very friendly. They are willing to share knowledge. Whatever they know or whatever result of study they find out, they will put into the database and everyone is free to access it. You definitely can learn a lot of technical stuff if you are in the R&D team.. Cons: They expect you to work for long hours with very low pay. They just pay S$9 per hour for over-time and you are expected to stay back till 9pm or 10pm. The office hours is from 8am to 5.30pm. Sometimes, you are required to come during Saturday and Sunday. It is better not to come on any weekend. Once you tell that you can come on one weekend, you will be asked to come every weekend. The working hours are not that flexible. If you are late for just even 1 second, they will deduct your salary. Every morning, every one is supposed to sing the company song. Then, depending on the group you are in, some group managers expect the employees to tell what they plan to do in a day. You can't have nothing to say. If you have nothing to say, it will give bad impression to the manager (especially software group). This will affect your review. Besides, you are not expected to say the same thing every morning. If you do that, the manager will ask you when you are going to finish you job. Every Friday, you are expected to write in a weekly report, telling what you have done in the whole week. This is kind of getting monitored all the while. The so-called ""Adviser"" of the software group keeps saying that if you have doubt on something, you can seek advice from him. When you really seek advice, he will ask what you plan to do. Ridiculous, huh? If you never hear of a software general manager who doesn't know software, you can find in this company. The software so-called GM never side to the local employees. He sides Japan very much more than anything. If Japan says one thing, he dares not confront. In the end, it is the Singapore software group to suffer. One of the colleagues' wife had internal bleeding due to pregnancy, he asked for leave. The software GM disallowed him to take leave. Is this human?? Secondly, it is the management side. They keep saying that they have no money for our increment and bonus. Yet, you can see the Japanese ""Advisers"", who are stationed here, are given a car each and a condominium each to stay with their families. When some colleagues are to stationed in Singapore for a few days, they are asked to stay in a hotel which costs less than S$100 per night. You can imagine what kind of hotel that is. When some Japanese are sent to work in Singapore for a few days, they are offered 5-star hotel in the city. Can you imagine how terrible this company is. Yet, our increment is S$10 to S$30 per year. That is less than 1% of slightly more than 1%. If you compare to the inflation rate, you will become poorer and poorer as you work for many years in this company. Yet, some Japanese advisers can play the ""rich-people game"", GOLF. The software adviser, when has nothhing to do, will practise the skill in front of the employees. Besides, you are given only 2 uniforms and are expected to wear for 5 days. Terrible... They become richer and richer and you will become poorer and poorer slaves forever. If you like this kind of company, Panasonic AV Networks Singapore is a place for you.

Panasonic Avionics is rated 2.6, almost an entire point lower putting the company in the bottom percentile Speaks for itself. Positive reviews are vague one-liners contrast that with negative reviews that are specific critique‚Äôs and paragraphs long. This dichotomy is an accurate reflection of the company‚Äôs culture. Some in comfortable positions are oblivious of market factors, customer complaints, and toxic culture. Those trying to effect change have to move over, around, or work harder to make up for those hanging out and getting paid. The result, frustration drives top talent out effecting a complete talent drain. If you are hoping to grow or work on challenging but rewarding projects look elsewhere. Business leaders are stuck in time warp regarding public demand for aviation connectivity. They still call their systems IFE [Inflight Entertainment] a reference to the hardware they sell, when hardware is becoming obsolete. Before applying to this company, I recommend you check out their ‚Äúofferings‚Äù page found at Panasonic.aero/our-offerings/ Airlines who are projected to take 10+ years to regain the passage volume they had in Feb 2020 are either removing these products, pulling services back in the house, or eliminating them in hopes of surviving. The passenger‚Äôs connectivity expectation in 10 years will look completely different from that of today. Panasonic Avionics business model was not to invest in R&D or innovated their offerings but to doubled down on customization, offering thousands of variations on the same product to blend in with the customers' cabin color schemes. This plethora of choice which captured a lion share of the market in the ‚Äô90s is the overhead turned millstone around their neck of today. Case and point even before COVID Panasonic Avionics had several rounds of layoffs in 2019 pre pandemic. Post pandemic their customers are fighting to meet payroll. For several years to come IFE will be nowhere in the budget discussion. The lack of innovation can be seen at all levels of the business. The perks offered, the evaluation process, promotion opportunities, the lack of training, and the leadership styles of managers. All stuck in a 1990‚Äôs mindset. Case in point up until 2019 the company had contractors on assignment for years at a time. The coworker I sat next to had been on contract for 5+ years before he was downsized at the last layoff. Shocked Panasonic Avionics hasn‚Äôt been sued. Can you say class action? Panasonic Avionics is a subsidiary of Panasonic and whole owned, meaning employees are not eligible for stock. Compensation is made up primarily of one‚Äôs base salary with a small yearly bonus that is derived on the profitability of the company as a whole. Not an individual‚Äôs contribution. Let me explain why this is a horrific situation should you join the company in hopes of growing your career. The compensation model uncouples performance and accountability at all levels of the business. Leaders are incentivized to maintain the statues vs investing in innovating for the future. And innovate is what Panasonic Avionics needed to do over the last 15 years to survive. This breeds a culture of apathy. Leadership coupled with company prospects are so bad I‚Äôm dusting off my resume and am in a full job search during the COVID lockdown. Time to get off the sinking ship.

Working here has been a real low-point in my career and life due to the quality of people I was forced to follow. Management in Lake Forest is a literal joke; very few supervisors are respected and managers and directors might as well be on the moon for all they contribute to the daily grind. In the last two years, they couldn't even figure out how to fix or alleviate the awful parking and bathroom situations. In fact, every inexplicable action taken simply put more burden on workers. After removing all the cubicles and sticking employees together elbow-to-elbow at long tables, we all started catching colds and getting sick more often. (In retrospect, another preeminently bad decision by executives.) In return, raises were cancelled and cute little music videos started appearing on the internal Yammer site, claiming we were all part of one big family and promoting solidarity. It was laughable; they simply couldn't do anything right to turn the morale ship around. The recent layoffs were handled with typical inelegance; no phone calls, emails or handshakes - just a mass Teams meeting with access cut off for an encore. Panasonic tried so hard to create the illusion of a positive culture but it was like watching the Flex tape guy invite you into his boat - you just knew that the whole thing was bound to come apart sooner rather than later, driven by maniacs (or in this case, idiots). #ONETEAM",Software Development Engineer,"Lake Forest, CA",reviews,objective,neutral,,,-0.2609,-0.05748813,negative,negative

Cons: Managers book meetings all day long to talk about problems which are never resolved. Slightly lower than average pay and since the legal troubles, company has shifted towards a colder, more corporate ""you work for us, whether you like it or not - now comply!"" type of culture. Cooperation between departments is non-existent and communication is often ignored. SJW-types have infected the HR and marketing departments and are pushing hard for 'diversity' - meaning, more women and minorities. If you don't fall into the right category or know the right person, promotions and raises are extremely hard to obtain, despite qualifications. HR in general pays little attention to employee concerns. Employee retention is a joke and morale is in the toilet but Panasonic thinks that having cute little events and campaigns will turn things around (or at least hide the pain).

Airline customers get the short end of the stick with our terrible software quality. Can't deliver anything on time. QA tests are very high level and aren't very thorough. It's who you know that gets you to the top of the food chain or it's how long you've been at the company. Either way, people get promoted for the wrong reasons. Old timers are stuck in the past and won't change for future growth. Going through lawsuit so there's no stability. Cleaning house constantly and re-organizing. They are playing 3 card monte with the employees by shoving new people as department heads and hoping no one notices that nothing has changed. Low pay compared to industry standards, can't attract good people. New people aren't trained, it's trial by fire. Most don't survive and burn out very quickly.

6745,6745,Panasonic Avionics Corporation,22/5/2010,A Very Poor Company. With High Turnover,1.0,"Pros: Pay Check Benefits are so so. Really no better than any other company of this size. A lot of employees come from very small aviation companies that offer limited or no benefits so the Panasonic benefits package tends to look really good. This really isn't true. They are average at best. In fact 401k matching contributions were suspended for close to 1 year.. Cons: After my first month at Panasonic Avionics there were almost too many red flags to describe. I was told the company was ISO AS9100 certified, yet I couldn't find any process to speak of. As I came to find out the certification was for hardware, not software. It's been 4 years and there are still no processes in place to speak of. The lack of any process was an unbelievable cause of frustration for so many people, in other departments as well. It created VERY long hours of work and stress because you spent most of your day chasing your tail rather than doing anything productive yet you were still responsible for your deliverables. When decisions were made there was no attempt to share these with other departments. The complete lack of communication was unbelievable. All this caused a revolving door where employees usually could only take about a year and then quit. This has slowed a bit but based on the feedback I get from other people, this is more to do with the economy than anything else. After all of this I started to question the capability of management and as I looked deeper into their qualifications, there were some, let's just say ""dubious decisions"" for hiring some senior managers. One could argue that this is just one persons observations, yet Panasonic Avionics continually score extremely low on customer satisfaction scores. One very large airline continually scores Panasonic as the worst of all vendors they deal with. My suggestion is to really think long and hard about accepting a position with this company. On a recent job interview that was for a company outside of this industry, the interviewer told me that he and another manager "" had very real concerns that I came from Panasonic . We feel that you have not been provided with adequate training or have developed bad habits"". I have been asked by several friends about going to work for Panasonic.
