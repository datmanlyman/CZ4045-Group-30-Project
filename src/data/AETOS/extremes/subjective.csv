No proper career progression, management in the HR Department does not recognize the people actually contributing to the department, especially in terms of moral. Recruitment Manager does not share any knowledge or information with his team, and he strikes me as someone who is very insecure (Afraid of someone taking his position). He does not treat his staff fairly, And has told his team numerous times that he will 'throw letter' when he loses his temper. Forced about 6 people to leave under his time as a Manager, and only took over in January 2016. Company itself is lacking vision, and do not treat their employees well.
