HR seems to be less dodgy then two years ago - at that time they would go behind a department's back to hire someone at lower than agreed pay.. Cons: This is a chaotic place to work - improvements are incremental, painstaking, and seemingly at the whims of senior management, irrespective of their relative positive or negative impact on employees, morale, or organization. For example, the company decided to stop illegally asking their casual staff to work more than 35 hours per week or 8 hours per day without benefits. Their course of action was to immediately restrict the hours worked by these staff - thousands of workers - with less than 24 hours notice. The communication flow for this change was atrocious, resulting in a work environment full of suspicion and resentment as thousands of workers suddenly were pay cut and thus suspicious and resentful of the company and full time workers. Months later, this toxic environment continued to be needlessly uncomfortable and unproductive.
