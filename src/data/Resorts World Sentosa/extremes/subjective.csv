Pay is reasonable, no 13th month.. Cons: RWS is like an unglam Chinese palace... There are plenty of hardworking and capable staff at the mercy of those favored by the ultimate boss. Some 'favorites' are bearable or even make reasonably good bosses but you will likely be managed by or be affected by the leadership of inexperienced individuals who rose up the ranks for unexplained reasons and no signs of true capability. Extremely frequent reorgs are normal --- crucial or pivotal teams and departments get managed suddenly by someone with little management experience, capability, and domain knowledge. Nothing you can do about it as it's the emperor's orders. These comments are specific to those with work experience and seeking full-time positions and to accumulate work experience, or worse seeking a 'career' in RWS. You will be worth so much more in other organisations with a more positive and healthier culture. For casual or part-timer positions or fresh graduates, RWS will be a 'fun' and positive workplace if they are not embroiled in palace matters. You can be one who has *seen it all* or is resilient or able to survive such environment by adopting a ""what don't kill you make you stronger"" mindset or strive to be one of the favorites. Do consider many times if you want to waste your time and energy trying to handle or battle the biased culture and toxicity. Not worth it.

Cons: As the title suggests, whatever the company plans or does, it's for their own benefits. Senior management or long-stayers (over-stayers in human context) only execute instructions / commands to please one person. HR does not protect employees as policies are planned based on the thinking and opinions of one person. Performance Appraisal is just a paper exercise to protect the company against potential backlash from MOM (just in case some unhappy employees complain, they can use it to support the so-called poor performance). So don't expect HR to protect employees in this company. Employees do well when they choose the right camps. Being in the right camp means you can get promoted easily and whatever that you share, it becomes the most precious piece of work or advice produced (doesn't matter if it is already circulating in the human world for more than 5 years or even outdated). Innovation is simply the use of technology in the eyes of this company. Developing a mobile app is considered innovation; does not matter if the app serves no purpose of the customers. Always remember the rule #1 (see the title). Employees get transferred around regardless of skillsets and usually without training provided. Employees are merely like pawn pieces to play with based on the mood of one person or the subordinates of the one person. Change is a constant and logical thinking from outside world is not acceptable. So march is the exodus period when employees claim their bonus and leave.

Cons: This is a chaotic place to work - improvements are incremental, painstaking, and seemingly at the whims of senior management, irrespective of their relative positive or negative impact on employees, morale, or organization. For example, the company decided to stop illegally asking their casual staff to work more than 35 hours per week or 8 hours per day without benefits. Their course of action was to immediately restrict the hours worked by these staff - thousands of workers - with less than 24 hours notice. The communication flow for this change was atrocious, resulting in a work environment full of suspicion and resentment as thousands of workers suddenly were pay cut and thus suspicious and resentful of the company and full time workers. Months later, this toxic environment continued to be needlessly uncomfortable and unproductive.
