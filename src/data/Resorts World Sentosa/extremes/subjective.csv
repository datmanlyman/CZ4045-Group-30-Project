Cons: - Spend $ to get Islander membership cause it's much faster to get in than RWS8 (Only free if you board from H'Front Ctr and makes a big round to turn into RWS) - Toxic, manipulative and no EQ bosses who don't know what they want and only have negative/counterproductive feedback to the work you have done. Likes to belittle other BUs behind their backs. - Very fast-paced and merciless culture (e.g. Morning request for a proposal deck and EOD you better produce it or you'll get it real bad by the bosses) - High pressure and high stress environment - Often rush to prepare decks for nothing and end up on hold/delayed/axed cause management didn't like it or cause suddenly no budget or suddenly something else became a priority (Strategic direction changes so often until you don't seem to know what exactly is the direction) - OT a lot, poor work-life balance and worst, no respect for your work-life balance (e.g. Bosses often text you on weekdays 9/10pm to ask about things and probably you need to do it thereafter or the next day morning) - Whole organization is in a big mess (legacy issues when predecessors didn't handover properly which resulted in everyone being clueless and overall, you can feel it when you work with other BUs) - In-house systems plagued with lots of issues/problems and management don't seem willing to set aside more $ to make it better. Worse of all, there are quite a no. of systems in place and a lot of them are not interlinked to each other (Another set of problems altogether). - HR/organization doesn't advocate work-life balance and ""kampung"" spirit is non-existent - Remuneration, perks, benefits and everything else in btw is low/pathetic for the pain you have to go through - A lot of unnecessary work processes (e.g. Fill up 3 forms just to prepare a simple EDM/SMS) and a lot of it are so manual which you waste time doing things like this when you can be doing more important tasks - Arrowed to help out in things totally unrelated to your work (Clear queue + assist in customer enquires for those who wanted to convert their USS 1 day tix to Season Pass and SDA duties to ""check"" on patrons) - What you learn/experience here may not be valuable/useful/transferrable if you wanna move out to another industry",Marketing,Singapore,reviews,subjective,negative,,,-0.9048,0.004116162,negative,positive

The staff food in Marina Bay Sands instead feels like you're eating in a five-star hotel buffet. It's no wonder you don't see management level people eating in the cafeteria of RWS while you often see management levels in MBS eating together with the staffs. -Benefits are atrocious for those who have had worked in better environments/ hotel groups. -All talk no action in all levels. -They suck you dry until you wanted to leave then they offer you promotion. It's something I found out later on from others that joined from outside to the same position. But they pay those that just join in higher than those being internally promoted. And normally they tried to that those of lower levels do as much as possible till the limit before they even consider any promotions. -So much more that is wrong with this organization that I'm not gonna write anymore.

Some 'favorites' are bearable or even make reasonably good bosses but you will likely be managed by or be affected by the leadership of inexperienced individuals who rose up the ranks for unexplained reasons and no signs of true capability.

Nothing you can do about it as it's the emperor's orders.

You will be worth so much more in other organisations with a more positive and healthier culture. For casual or part-timer positions or fresh graduates, RWS will be a 'fun' and positive workplace if they are not embroiled in palace matters.

Cons: As the title suggests, whatever the company plans or does, it's for their own benefits. Senior management or long-stayers (over-stayers in human context) only execute instructions / commands to please one person. HR does not protect employees as policies are planned based on the thinking and opinions of one person. Performance Appraisal is just a paper exercise to protect the company against potential backlash from MOM (just in case some unhappy employees complain, they can use it to support the so-called poor performance). So don't expect HR to protect employees in this company. Employees do well when they choose the right camps. Being in the right camp means you can get promoted easily and whatever that you share, it becomes the most precious piece of work or advice produced (doesn't matter if it is already circulating in the human world for more than 5 years or even outdated). Innovation is simply the use of technology in the eyes of this company. Developing a mobile app is considered innovation; does not matter if the app serves no purpose of the customers. Always remember the rule #1 (see the title). Employees get transferred around regardless of skillsets and usually without training provided. Employees are merely like pawn pieces to play with based on the mood of one person or the subordinates of the one person. Change is a constant and logical thinking from outside world is not acceptable. So march is the exodus period when employees claim their bonus and leave.

10919,10919,Resorts World Sentosa,22/12/2015,Little promotion lots of rubbish managers,1.0,Pros: Perks and free entry to attractions. You get to work at a place with many holiday makers so generally people there are friendly. Exclude those that lost money in the casino.. Cons: Little or no progression in career. Especially Singaporeans. They seem to prefer promoting their own people. It is a Malaysian company after all. Lots of foreigners and Singaporeans are treated like 2nd class workers. Managers and upper management are very bad at decision making. Inconsistent in their ability to manage. Seriously wonder how the hell they got there!! They are very stingy in pay increases and perks.,Casino Table Games Pit Supervisor,Casino,reviews,subjective,neutral,,,-0.2629,0.042222222,negative,positive
